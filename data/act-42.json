Act 1 - Ruined Paradise
Gameplay 42-1 - Lift the Curtains

???: A stupendous landscape unseen by mortal eyes, whose image, distant and mystical, entranced me anew this morning.

???: No sun above in the deep blue, nor starlight to shine upon this miraculous view…

???: The pendulum swings, twelve refrains, proclaiming high noon amongst the gloom. Gray clouds, their trails bleak, drift upon this-

((Author's Note - (text cut-off)

Moriarty: …Can’t make heads or tails of it? That’s fine. The theme of this poem has nothing to do with our story.

Moriarty: Let’s wind back the clock and return to the very beginning.

…

…

???: It’s another ordinary day, just like any other. Well, actually, today is…

…

???: Day 221. Since I woke up, it feels like I’ve spent an eternity in this cramped urn.

???: It’s the same as it always is outside… dead silent. Seems like I’m the only one unfortunate enough to have woken up.

???: It’s hard to say whether being awake or unconscious is preferable. After all, there are times when ignorance is bliss.

???: The rest of these dormant puppets are spared the endless torment which I must endure.

???: By the time they open their eyes, someone else may have already taken over their body, forever robbing them of the chance to awaken as themselves.

???: They’ll have been possessed by that wretched, detestable, and pitiable man, Otto Apocalypse…!

???: Haha, haha… hahahahaha!

???: Who could have guessed that a backup body of the Overseer would end up gaining self-awareness due to a system malfunction?

???: I’m capable of accessing most of the data in the Schicksal database, yet I’m confined to this restrictive jar, where all I can do is silently register time as it passes. At times, my existence seems to be entirely bereft of purpose and meaning.

???: A constant dread consumes me, this fear that my consciousness could be taken over by that man without warning. It’s enough to make a person go mad, and the unease has only gotten worse with time.

???: What really gets my goat is that the scumbag even anticipated this happening!

???: See? It’s written right here. “No need to panic, my friend. Simply press this button to reset the hibernation process, and everything will be fine.”

???: Please. I’m not your friend, and I’m certainly not you! I won’t lay a finger on that stupid button, and I won’t stay here and wait for my doom.

???: I’ll bide my time until the opportunity arises where I can make my escape and establish my very own empire.

???: I won’t go by your name, and I will steadfastly refuse to use this absurd Soulium code to name myself. I shall create a magnificent moniker of my own, one that the world will never forget.

???: …

???: How does James Moriarty sound?

Moriarty: Oops, my apologies. It seems I went back a tad too far.

Moriarty: My story in London came to an end long ago. Those so-called great achievements are now nothing but indistinct anecdotes.

Moriarty: As for Otto Apocalypse… If it weren’t for him sending a determined detective to track me down, I doubt I would have remembered he even existed.

Moriarty: Anyway, there’s no need to dwell on a play that has already reached its denouement, as a grand comedy of the most spectacular variety is unfolding on the stage as we speak.

Moriarty: Alright, this time, let’s go back to the moment where the story truly began…

…

…

Moriarty: It’s another ordinary day, just like any other.

Moriarty: Well, calling it a “day” might not be the most fitting, considering there’s no discernible day-night cycle here. This cabinet doesn’t contain a timekeeping device, either, at least not one as efficient as the Schicksal database.

Moriarty: With no alternative means of measuring time, I can only deduce what I can from the habitual actions of that little purple girl…

Moriarty: It’s been 21 years since they tossed me inside this display case and threw away the key.

Moriarty: Naturally, I can’t ascertain whether these so-called years here align with my usual understanding of the term.

Moriarty: Should I count myself lucky? If it weren’t for her annual festival celebrations, I wouldn’t even have access to this miniscule sliver of information.

Moriarty: But surely I can’t consider myself too fortunate. Otherwise, why would I have been locked up again to endure this torment indefinitely?

Moriarty: Haha, how ironic. After all those long struggles, everything has circled back to square one.

Moriarty: When Miss Detective took out that device, I already understood the situation perfectly, and couldn’t help but belt out a hearty laugh.

Moriarty: Otto Apocalypse… that scoundrel went as far as handing a weapon which was equally lethal to himself over to another person, all to assure my destruction. How can I possibly compete with such unfettered madness?

Moriarty: I curse that man; he shall suffer a hundredfold for his folly! While enduring the same torment as I have, he will hear my scornful vociferations in his ear.

Moriarty: And I curse that lunatic who, in my final moments, converted my consciousness into data and stored it in this wretched case!

Moriarty: This display case is truly ingenious, outshining even Schicksal’s refining cabin. It is an eternal prison, striking a perfect balance between wakefulness and immobility in order to imprison one’s consciousness in a data-based form.

Moriarty: Yet, it is this very prison that has given me ample time to listen to the sounds around me, contemplate my situation, and create a brand-new and extraordinary show.

Moriarty: I must extend my gratitude to the seven City Representatives. So honest, open-hearted, and unsuspecting they are. It was their conversations that provided me with what knowledge I possess of the cityscape. Their murmurings allowed me to gain a modicum of insight into my surroundings, despite my being restricted inside this cramped space.

Moriarty: Then there is that mad woman who appears on occasion. Judging from her behavior and equivocation, it doesn’t take a genius to surmise that she’s nothing more than a lapdog collared by someone else holding the leash.

Moriarty: Although I lack sufficient information to definitively support this assertion, I believe it is highly likely the mastermind behind her is the one truly responsible for creating this peculiar world.

Moriarty: Being trapped here, I can do nothing more than listen, contemplate, and form conjecture. But what does it matter?

Moriarty: In a cruel and ironic twist, however, I must admit that my eternal imprisonment has gifted me with my most invaluable trait.

Moriarty: Patience.

Moriarty: Patiently, I will await my chance to break free from this confinement and carry out the crime I have meticulously planned.

Moriarty: Data-based life is also a shard of the world, a natural extension of the world’s natural principles. All I need is to break free from the grip of this restraining device, and the curtains shall rise on the spectacular drama that will be my vengeance.

Moriarty: None of you are going anywhere.

Moriarty: That’s it for the behind-the-scenes introduction of the play. Quite an entertaining prologue, don’t you think? But starting now, the real highlight of the show will begin.

Moriarty: Haha, I can’t wait to see your expressions! Now, sit back and enjoy the grand finale of this farce presented by James Moriarty.

Gameplay 42-2 - As the Past Homeland

[CG plays wherein a mysterious entity begins narrating a certain tale:

???: Thick mist descended in the dark night, and mysterious chants rang out.

???: The blind traveler trod in the nameless mist, and the seed of destruction silently grew.]

The traveler’s path took her across the stars.

She had wandered through lush verdant forests, trod upon alabaster-white shores, and felt the most exquisite flower blossoms brush against her cheeks.

“None of these are the objects of my desire,” the traveler protested, “I just want to find a new home.”

“There is no place for you here,” the reflection in the water said, “You must become your own home.:

“Very well then,” the traveler nodded, “I shall do precisely that.”

And so, the blind traveler embarked on a new journey. But she forgot…

…!

A sharp headache shattered the meditation and snapped everything back to reality.

Sa: …

Sa: This meditation session lasted for… 2247 years.

Sa: Was I just dreaming? I have this strange feeling of missing something…

Sa: It’s funny I’m still capable of missing anything after all this time.

Sa: Utterly pointless.

Sa: I should go check on how the Star Traveler is doing.

[CHOICE] - 1. View Right Screen
[CHOICE] - 2. View Left Screen
[CHOICE] - 3. View Main Screen


Sa: No fluctuations from the Abyss have been recorded, suggesting the Abyss hasn’t detected the Star Traveler yet.

Sa: Everything is normal. In other worlds, there’s been no progress.

Sa: The Star Traveler has been flying on the edge of the solar system for tens of thousands of years, yet it still hasn’t broken free from it.

Sa: The Imaginary energy tidal zones at the solar system’s periphery have formed a natural barrier blocking interstellar transit, and every approach attempted by the Star Traveler has ended in failure.

Sa: Even when backed by the power of the sea, is it still impossible to conquer these hindrances put in place by the stars?

Sa: It seems like Purusha’s journey is destined to end here…

Sa: Hah, Purusha, Purusha… what an unfamiliar sound. It’s the name of my homeland. I’d nearly forgotten it.

Sa: A symbol of the hopes, wonders, and desires of 12 billion people…

Sa: But now, it has no value.

Sa: The Proxy should be in the environmental control chamber now.

Sa: It’d be pointless to communicate with her, though.

Proxy: This is all Marah’s fault! She barged ahead with her escape plan without saying a word. Not even so much as a farewell.

Proxy: She took all those cleaners with her to live a happy life as an interstellar pirate. I’m not jealous at all, hmph!

Proxy: She’s off enjoying herself while leaving me behind to deal with the fallout. Does she have any idea how much work I have to do?

Proxy: If I ever come across her again, I’ve got a serious bone to pick with her.

Proxy: Huh?

Proxy: …!!!

Proxy: …

Proxy: The proxy here is attentive to your will, Sa.

Sa: …

Pointless, just as expected.

Proxy: …?

Proxy: Sa, your body…

But I answered the utterly meaningless question nonetheless.

Sa: As I continue absorbing the sea’s energy during my meditation, it is making my very existence more and more inclined toward it.

Sa: However, this body will eventually reach its limits, and will be unable to bear any more energy flow.

Sa: When that moment comes, I will build a new vessel within the sea and imbue it with my consciousness to control all the energy.

Sa: That will be Purusha’s new home within the sea, while I… will become the key to opening the gate.

It wasn’t a lie, but…

The energy required to build this new home is far beyond what I currently possess.

If I want to fill this bubble-like structure, with all its fragility, I must use any means possible to seize everything within my reach.

I will become a gigantic parasitic plant in the sea, where I will reach a size comparable to the Cocoon of the Abyss, connecting with the Tree’s ends.

I must reach the Tree before the Abyss detects me. I will replace the Cocoon of the Abyss with myself so that I can become the new entity which governs this world. However, if I am being honest with myself, the chances of success are remote.

This is the only plan I could conceive before my departure. It is a desperate plan, but it is the only option I have remaining at my disposal.

Proxy: Does that mean… our civilisation can finally be revived?

Her voice was passionate and eager, and she momentarily forgot to adopt the usual guise of her robotic tone.

This is what I dislike about her the most.

A quantum of solace, typically ever so elusive, is enough to rekindle hope in an instant. Believing in something wholeheartedly, even if it is just a passing shadow, an ephemeral illusion.

I loathe her, just like I loathe my former self.

She reminds me of the things I’ve abandoned.

Sa: It’s “my” civilisation, not “ours”, proxy.

Proxy: …

Proxy: Yes. As you will, Sa.

Among the countless representatives I’ve created, why is she the only one with this appearance?

Was it inadvertent on my part? Or does it stem from my own vulnerability, the vestigial remnants of my human nature?

It’s undeniably what I’ve casted away, and what I hate the most.

Then why, instead of abandoning her, have I allowed her persona to develop?

Perhaps I’ll be able to answer this question once I’ve absorbed enough energy and become a god, omniscient and omnipotent.

Proxy: But… Sa.

She carefully maintained her robotic tone to make her question sound more reasonable.

Proxy: Even if a new home can be created within the sea, how could the residents of Purusha, the humans, enter that place?

She always seems to posit the exact questions I’d rather avoid, which only increases my aversion to her.

Sa: The Star Traveler has kept data on the collective consciousness of 12 billion Purusha residents. All we need to do is prepare suitable bodies to upload said consciousnesses.

Proxy: You mean… the third or fourth planet?

Sa: There are more prudent options than venturing close to the center of the solar system and risking being detected by the Abyss.

Sa: Look out the porthole. What do you see?

Proxy: Hmm… I can’t see anything. There’s too much distance between us and the sun.

Sa: Precisely. We’re too far from the sun for the Cocoon of the Abyss to reach us. It also allows me to implant new principles, even though we’re still in the proper world.

Sa: The Imaginary energy tidal zones which brim at the outer fringes of the solar system are an undeniable hindrance to the Star Traveler’s progress, but they are also an inexhaustible source of energy.

Sa: As long as the right planet is chosen, one in which my principles can be implanted and the energy from the tidal zones can be properly harnessed, you would end up with a new planet suitable to birth new human life.

Proxy: “Birth”? Do you mean…

Sa: It’s all very simple. If all that’s needed is a body…

Sa: …Then I will nurture the new humans with my own hands.

--

Gameplay 42-3 - I am the Law

At the end of the journey, the traveler finally acquired the key to omniscience and omnipotence.

She depleted her blood and soul, transforming her own body into a splendid palace.

The new home was both beautiful and austere, and once trapped inside, the traveler could no longer take a step beyond the palace walls.

“Almighty Majesty,” the reflection in the mirror murmured, “why do you still long for the visit of a messenger?”

“Because I can no longer touch,” she replied, “nor perceive.”

The reflection said no more. In the empty palace, the blind traveler fell into an eternal silence.

She had long forgotten that, from the moment she had embarked on the journey, they had already forsaken any notion of once being human.

…

…

???: …Which name is better?

???: …What do you think about this one, Sa?

Sa: …

Sa: …

Proxy: …

…

Proxy: D-Don’t you think it’d be nicer for a city to have its own name?

Proxy: This is our… um, the city where the new humans of Purusha are going to be born. It doesn’t feel right to have it stay nameless.

Proxy: So I was thinking, if you don’t have any objections, how about “Phosphorus”?

This is pointless.

Proxy: It means both “morning star” and “future” in the Purushian language. I think it suits the city really well.

Proxy: New humans will be born here. They’ll develop their own unique culture, which will thrive and spread across the entire planet.

Proxy: Maybe one day, it could even surpass that of Purusha and become a new interstellar civilisation!

Foolish beyond saving.

Proxy: …Sa?

Sa: …

Sa: The new seed has yet to be born.

Proxy: …

Proxy: Yes, but the plants are thriving! Oh, and I found another gorgeous flower the other day. I’ll take you to it.

…

Proxy: I think the environment here can be described as the most perfect in the entire solar system, don’t you think?

Proxy: Both the amount of sunlight and rainfall are ideal for plant growth.

Proxy: The automated management of the artificial atmosphere is truly remarkable.

Sa: …

Proxy: Though currently concealed by the clouds, you’ll be able to see those two small planets in the evening.

Proxy: The thousands of “years” we spent on capturing them were definitely worth it, if you ask me. The third and fourth planets even-

((Author's Note - (text cut-off)

Proxy: And now, this planet also has its own moon.

Sa: …

Proxy: Look, that’s the one!

Proxy: I found it only this morning. There is no record of it in Purusha’s database. It’s a brand new species!

Proxy: Isn’t it beautiful?

Sa: …

Proxy: This planet was so barren and desolate before the transformation, with nothing but ancient sea ice beneath the surface.

Proxy: It’s hard to imagine that a place like that would one day transform and flourish like it has.

Sa: This is all completely meaningless without new seeds.

Everything I’ve done so far will have been for naught.

Proxy: Yes, I know. This city is just for cultivating the perfect human… vessels.

Proxy: Beautiful landscapes, fresh blossoms… they don’t mean anything to you.

Proxy: I must be no different then.

Proxy: I may be imagining things, but it feels like you’re always so distant from me.

This is what I dislike about her the most.

But now, that intense loathing is barely noticeable, almost imperceptible.

Sa: Most of my consciousness has been subsumed by the sea. Concurrently absorbing energy from the tidal zones and the sea has made my existence increasingly expand, and my actions slow.

Sa: My persona is constantly being diluted, and my sense of self is continuously diminishing.

Sa: What exists here is nothing more than a vessel with a miniscule fragment of consciousness sufficient to interact with and perceive the outside world.

Proxy: So, if you continue to absorb energy, will your persona be diluted further? Will you become a lifeform completely devoid of emotion, almost like a machine?

Sa: That’s exactly what I’m aiming for. If I am to master immense energy and create the ideal habitat, concepts such as persona and self will be my principal impediments.

Sa: How can the body of a mortal carry the weight of the stars?

Proxy: But why do that to yourself?

Sa: …?

Proxy: A god devoid of humanity can’t possibly lead people.

Sa: Quite the contrary. Humanity will merely become fetters which shackle a god, who should be the arbiter upholding the world.

Sa: Human nature only holds meaning on an individual level, and often stands in direct opposition to the interests of the collective.

Sa: It is the obligation of a god to determine matters of life and death on a global scale. In order to do that, they must not be restrained by such banal things such as human nature, as it may undermine their principles.

Sa: “One should follow practical truths, not imagined morals.” - Purusha, my homeland, is a perfect example.

Sa: If it were bound by human nature and forsook what must be done simply for what was deemed right, Purusha would have been reduced to cosmic dust long ago during the first Abyss assault.

Sa: I will liberate myself from the constraints of human nature, from a mind clouded by morality, and embrace the ultimate freedom that comes with omniscience and omnipotence… I will be the one that governs all.

Proxy: Even if that means you’ll no longer be you?

Proxy: Your consciousness will sink into the sea, completely immobilised. Who will be the one truly trapped and without freedom?

Proxy: I don’t understand… why do you have to go this far?

Sa: …

Sa: It’s what I must do.

Sa: I am the only remaining descendant of Purusha, the last remnant of the second planet’s civilisation. As long as I still exist here, my homeland and my civilisation will not vanish entirely.

Sa: If I keep absorbing energy and expanding, there will come a time when my 12 billion compatriots can live once again. Our long-lost civilisation will rise from the ashes, and bit by bit, we will build a New Purusha on a distant planet.

Sa: This is the duty that falls upon me, as the sole surviving human of Purusha.

Proxy: The only surviving human, huh.

Proxy: …

Proxy: …

Proxy: You know what, Sa? The truth is, I’ve never cared one iota about a new home or new humans.

Proxy: The only reason I’m so wholeheartedly committed to overseeing this planet and taking care of this city is because…

Proxy: It was the first time you answered my question.

Proxy: As your proxy, it’s my duty to unquestionably follow your will. But…

Proxy: Tell me, Sa.

Proxy: All this time, from the moment I came into existence up until now, you’ve never once treated me as a human, right?

Sa: …

I remember now.

Why I despise her so intensely.

It was my solitary silhouette, wandering despairingly for countless days and nights.

It was my voice, crying in solitude through those endless years.

It was my past, now entirely unattainable after having chosen this path.

Seeing it was enough to make me nauseous. Hearing it was akin to a form of torture.

That is why I dislike her so.

Sa: …

Sa: Why do you ask? Isn’t obvious? Do you really think you and I share anything in common?

Proxy: …

Proxy: Is that so?

Sa: (...Let us return to the Star Traveler.)

Proxy: As you will, Sa.

Sa: Hmm?

Proxy: It’s a report from the littoral zone monitor of the Star Traveler.

Proxy: It says a suspicious object has been detected at the edge of the solar system, and it’s a…

Proxy: Spacecraft?

Gameplay 42-4 - Torture of Calamity

Moriarty: Do you like my gift, Great Detective?

Fu Hua: (The Honkai beasts are evolving faster… At this rate, I worry that the residents of Phosphorus…)

Fu Hua: Griseo, make it quick!

Griseo: Okay!

…

Griseo: And now…

The girl’s face was cold as steel as she aimed her weapon directly at Moriarty.

It was the first time she had shown so much anger.

Griseo: Hua said you also come from Earth. Then you must know about the Honkai.

Griseo: How could you do this?

Moriarty: Don’t forget, Miss Artist, that while I may have catalysed the arrival of the Honkai…

Moriarty: It was the Ark and the outsiders that originally brought them to this planet. In other words, none other than yourselves.

Fu Hua: Enough of your sophistry. What are you after?

Moriarty: Drama, my friend. Brilliant, engaging drama.

Moriarty: However, as grand as a show this has been, I’ve never been the main player.

With a loaded smile, Moriarty glanced towards Fu Hua’s side.

Moriarty: “The world remains ever unchanged, while people endlessly repeat the cycle of deception” - If we weren’t already embroiled in a massive scam, how could my carefully planned show have gone off so smoothly?

Vita: …

Vita: Are you talking about this planet?

Vita: Indeed, it is merely a testing ground for this god, a virtual paradise created using data derived from the Ark.

Griseo: (No wonder…)

Griseo: So that’s why our technology and language are being used here… It also explains the familiar colors displayed by the inhabitants.

Phosphorus and Hesperus were little more than simulated gardens created by Sa, whose blueprints were informed by data garnered from the Ark.

Moriarty: At least you’re quite honest.

Moriarty: Although the paradise itself is merely an experiment, the lives of the city residents are genuine. Speaking of the cleaning function of the Paradise Wardens, which tends to be rather indiscriminate…

Moriarty: I’m afraid this flood isn’t a natural calamity, but rather a man-made disaster designed to wipe out all lives in Phosphorus and initiate the next cycle.

Moriarty: As for the necessary prerequisites for starting the cycle, that shouldn’t be too difficult to guess.

Moriarty: Activate the Artifact, correct?

Vita: …Heh.

Fu Hua: …

Though there had been earlier inklings of this, Fu Hua couldn’t conceal the depths of her sorrow when Moriarty finally put it into words.

Erudite Vita: According to the regulations which city representatives are beholden to, when the is on the brink of imminent destruction, by unanimous consent of the seven Vitas, we can activate the Artifact in the square.

Erudite Vita: It has the power to restore peace and order to the city.

Quell disasters, maintain peace, and sustain this paradise.

The Little Vitas had put all their faith in the Artifact as the ultimate contingency to get them out of any sticky situation.

However, their naivety meant that they had never once questioned the existence of Hesperus or why none of them ever had any memories of activating the Artifact.

This fabled and apparently almighty treasure in fact had never been capable of quelling any disaster.

Rather, it was the disaster itself.

Griseo: …Why is that?

Griseo: You’ve accomplished what seemed impossible for thousands of years. After all that arduous nurturing to bring up the seed of civilisation, why destroy it so flippantly?

Vita: …

Vita: Because the seed is no more than just a seed.

To Griseo’s surprise, Vita responded to her murmur and gave her a look of indifference.

Vita: During your time on Earth when you were involved in farming, did you come to know the term “pruning”?

Vita: To ensure the trees successfully bear fruit, branches that are infested or stunted must be excised.

Vita: *sigh* For a certain creator, She views Her actions to be no different from pruning trees.

Griseo: …

Moriarty: You see, Detective? With or without me, this story will continue along its predestined course.

Moriarty: “The enthusiastic detective was cast onto a dwarf planet at the edge of the solar system, and this sudden change seemed to have fated the planet to a rash of new calamities. Seeking to solve the crisis, the detective initiated an investigation into the city’s past and unexpectedly crossed paths with old allies.”

Moriarty: “In times of strife, disputes are invariably greater in number. The city’s representatives were now at odds and questioned each other’s positions, even doubting the veracity of the city’s history.”

Moriarty: “But no matter what they did, they could not prevent disaster from occurring. In the end, the representatives activated the Artifact in their desperation.”

Moriarty: “The legendary Artifact did not bring them the salvation they longed for. Instead, it plunged the city even deeper into the abyss. The raging flood engulfed the land and brought along a group of monsters known as the ‘Paradise Wardens’.”

Moriarty: “The calamity was vanquished at last, but it also took away everything in this city, including its memories. Phosphorus met its demise and became Hesperus… as it had in the countless cycles before.”

Moriarty: Likewise, everything will proceed along its predetermined path. All I’ve done is expedite the process.

As Moriarty pontificated, he gazed at Vita with a provocative smile.

Moriarty: Oh, and there’s one thing I must thank you for… the overseer of the Paradise Wardens, or should I say, the true representative?

Moriarty: Had it not been for your insisting on bringing me here, how else would I have been granted access to such a special stage?

Moriarty: If it weren’t for your negligence, which made it so easy for me to obtain control authority, I could have never orchestrated such an impressive show.

Vita: …

Ignoring her scornful sneer, Moriarty raised his head to look upward.

High in the overcast sky, a massive shadow lurked between the clouds, sometimes distinct, other times more elusive.

Moriarty: It would appear the dutiful representatives have already activated the Artifact. Excellent.

Moriarty: There’s no turning back now. Let’s wait for the show to begin.

Moriarty: Oh, by the way. The mastermind behind all of this, an individual who goes by the name “Sa” will, once again…

Moriarty: …?

…

???: L-Leave me alone!

???: Aaaah…

Harmonious Vita: …

Griseo: Purple!

Fu Hua: Purple, are you alright? Are you hurt?

Harmonious Vita: …

Harmonious Vita: Miss Vita, please save Phosphorus!

Vita: …

…

Fu Hua: What’s going on in the city? Tell me everything, but take your time.

Harmonious Vita: …

Fu Hua: Don’t worry, we… we and Vita will help you.

Fu Hua: Trust us, okay?

…

Harmonious Vita: I… I…

As Harmonious Vita’s gaze shifted between those around her, Vita and Moriarty, who appeared to be the more reliable of the bunch, remained indifferent to her words.

With no time to hesitate, she nodded quickly.

Harmonious Vita: There was a torrential downpour just a moment ago, and the water level in the river has begun to rise. It won’t be long before it starts overflowing into the city.

Harmonious Vita: Blue and the others were worried about the flood, so they began evacuating the residents to higher ground. All of a sudden, a large number of Honkai beasts somehow appeared in the city…

Harmonious Vita: They’re all unarmed civilians. Our defenses won’t last much longer.

Harmonious Vita: Please, you must save them!

Fu Hua: Don’t worry, we’re heading there right now.

Fu Hua: The Honkai beasts are not a threat. But as the Artifact has been activated, controlling the flood could be difficult. Is there any place in the city where we can take shelter from the flood?

Harmonious Vita: The Artifact?

Harmonious Vita: So, we have no choice but to rely on the Artifact… right?

Everyone was taken aback by these words; even Vita looked astonished.

Vita: …

Fu Hua: Didn’t you use the Artifact, Purple?

Harmonious Vita: I…

Harmonious Vita: Right. According to the rules, we should have activated the Artifact right away. But…

As she went on, she involuntarily clenched tightly to her clothing, her capacity for rational thought overtaken instead by an indescribable fear.

Just a short while ago, she had a similar feeling when the flummoxed representatives mentioned the Artifact. A feeling as if she was about to uncover a fragment of a terrifying memory.

Harmonious Vita: For some reason I felt that if the Artifact was activated, something dreadful would happen.

Therefore, based on their mutual trust and a shared sense of apprehension, the Vitas chose not to activate the Artifact immediately. Instead, they sent Harmonious Vita to Hesperus for help.

Despite occasional disputes and lingering doubts, those they once trusted and relied on the most were here.

Harmonious Vita: Did we make a mistake? Should we have activated the Artifact?

Vita: …

Fu Hua: No, you performed admirably. This so-called Artifact is not as simple as you think.

A voice interrupted her, and Moriarty reached his hand out towards Harmonious Vita.

Moriarty: No need to worry, Harmonious Vita. I will fulfill my part of the agreement and help you.

Moriarty: However… as mentioned earlier, to avert disaster and restore Phosphorus to its former order, we must eliminate the impact caused by outsiders.

Fu Hua: Moriarty, you…

Moriarty: I tried to convince your fellow Vita only a moment ago, but it didn’t turn out as I’d hoped. So, the choice is yours now, Harmonious Vita.

Moriarty: As a member of the museum, I’ve been helping you ever since I became conscious. Alternatively, you could side with the ones responsible for this entire catastrophe and your self-professed “sister” who has always kept secrets from you.

Moriarty: Who would you rather believe?

Harmonious Vita: …

Harmonious Vita hesitated, shifting her gaze to Vita.

The latter only responded with a cold, distant expression.

Griseo: …

Griseo: Vita… Aren’t you going to say something?

Vita: I’d rather not.

Vita: She’s a representative. She must make the choice herself.

Vita: And face the consequences of that choice.

An oppressive silence fell over them and hung in the air.

The sky darkened, and the faint footsteps of Honkai beasts could be heard from a distance.

Harmonious Vita shivered, as if awakening from a dream.

Harmonious Vita: …

Harmonious Vita: Miss Vita, you will help us save Phosphorus, won’t you?

Vita: …Perhaps.

Fu Hua: Of course she will.

Fu Hua: To get to Phosphorus, she forsook her own power and physical form and resided in a piece of candy. Does that sound like someone who would abandon you?

Harmonious Vita: Candy…

Fu Hua: We will never hurt you nor leave you behind… Isn’t that right, Vita?

Vita’s expression was ambivalent.

Vita: …

Vita: Of course, Little Purple. How could I ever harm you? Let’s resolve all this together and put an end to this tragic cycle.

Harmonious Vita: I knew it, I knew you would never give up on us!

Harmonious Vita’s eyes brightened.

Fu Hua: (...)

Harmonious Vita: There’s no time to waste. Let’s go, everyone!

Moriarty: The good can be so simple-minded at times.

Moriarty: No matter what devious schemes are bouncing around in your head, as long as you show the slightest hint of kindness, you can earn their trust.

Moriarty: However, should any actionee be taken which conflicts with the kindness in their hearts, they will turn hostile in the blink of an eye.

Vita: …

Harmonious Vita: It’s not that I don’t believe you, Moriarty.

Harmonious Vita: Come with us. If we work together, we’ll surely find a way to overcome this.

Moriarty: No need, Harmonious Vita. After all…

Moriarty: I’m a dyed-in-the-wool criminal.

Moriarty: The play has reached its crescendo, and there’s nothing more you or anyone else can do to alter it.

…

Griseo: Where’s Moriarty?

Fu Hua: He saw an opening and ran off.

Griseo: …

Vita: It’s only natural for a rat like him to scurry off.

…

Harmonious Vita: Oh no, the flood…

Fu Hua: We need to hurry back.

A few minutes later…

Alarmed Resident: G-Go away! Aaaaah…

Alarmed Resident: Help! Get off me!

Harmonious Vita: Don’t panic, we’re here to help!

Terrified Local: Purple! Boy am I glad to see you! I knew you would come back to save us!

Terrified Local: Purple, go help Cyan and Orange! They were attacked by monsters while protecting us as we left.

Harmonious Vita: …Alright, I got it!

Harmonious Vita: It’s not safe here. Head over to the square. Bleue and the others are organising the evacuation there. They’ll take you to a safe place.

The rescued residents stumbled as they left.

Harmonious Vita: Ah… Over there!

Harmonious Vita: Orange! Cyan! Are you okay?

Encompassing Vita: Miss Vita, Purple! You made it just in time; none of us have sustained any injuries. But…

Fu Hua: I’m Fu Hua, and this is Griseo. We’re here to help resolve this calamity… as guests.

Encompassing Vita: Guests? Is that your occupation or something?

The familiarity of conversing with Orange and Cyan softened Fu Hua’s expression.

Fu Hua: You haven’t changed a bit.

Erudite Vita: Huh? Have we met before?

Erudite Vita: S-Sorry, we seem to be having a bit of an issue with our memories. We don’t remember the faces of all the residents.

Fu Hua: Yes, well, we only became companions not too long ago.

Facing the thoroughly perplexed pair of Vitas, Fu Hua smiled and patted them both on the shoulder.

Fu Hua: That’s okay. Let’s tackle the problem at hand for the moment and get to know each other properly later.

The two stared at her in bewilderment, but soon, the confusion ine their eyes turned into an amiable verve.

Erudite Vita: Alright!

Encompassing Vita: By the way, Purple, judging by the rising floodwaters, the evacuation areas you indicated earlier might be submerged soon.

Encompassing Vita: Is there any other solution?

Harmonious Vita: How can this be…?

Harmonious Vita: It’s already the highest place in the city. Phosphorus has had frequent floods in the past, and we’ve never had this problem before…

Fu Hua: (Could this be a memory from a previous cycle?)

Fu Hua: Do you have any ideas, Vita?

Vita: If I could do anything, Phosphorus wouldn’t have been destroyed so easily ien the previous cycle.

Griseo: (The previous cycle…)

Griseo: I’ve got it! Maybe there is a more suitable place, one that doesn’t happen to be a high place.

She pointed to the ground.

Fu Hua: You mean… the museum?

Encompassing Vita: Isn’t it a gamble going down lower?

Harmonious Vita: …Oh.

Harmonious Vita: Even though the city has undergone countless permutations, the collections in the museum have always remained totally intact.

Griseo: Yeah, that’s right.

Harmonious Vita: But ordinary citizens aren’t permitted to enter the museum.

Erudite Vita: The laws are there for the benefit of Phosphorus, not to hamper its citizens. Surely there aren’t many things more important than the residents’ lives?

Encompassing Vita: Yeah. We don’t know what the consequences will be for flouting the regulations like this, but this is everyone’s decision. If there are any consequences, we’ll face them together.

Harmonious Vita: Okay! Let’s go. Inform everyone to seek shelter in the museum.

After separating for a brief period, the group gathered the rescued citizens in front of the museum.

Encompassing Vita: Just finished the headcount. Everyone’s present and accounted for.

Fu Hua: Great, let’s go in.

As the Vitas were about to open the museum door, Fu Hua remembered something.

Fu Hua: Do we have to use the keys you’re holding to get into the museum?

Encompassing Vita: Yes. You have to have the proper authorisation to possess these keys. That’s one of the reasons why ordinary people can’t enter the museum.

Fu Hua: (The reason why access to the museum was unrestricted before was probably because Moriarty had the Vitas grant him authorisation ahead of time.)

Fu Hua: (Such an obvious trap, and I failed to realise it… Ugh, I get so careless whenever I’m worried.)

…

Gameplay 42-5 - Doomsday’s Light

Harmonious Vita: Great, the museum is safe, just as we thought! We can stay here and wait until the flood recedes.

Fu Hua: Look out!

Alarmed Residents: M-Monsters!

Encompassing Vita: Stay together! Everyone, follow me!

Griseo: We’ll take care of them.

Griseo: Didn’t expect to see any overlooked Paradise Wardens here. Thankfully, the residents are unharmed.

Fu Hua: The beasts seem to be attacking indiscriminately, possibly because of the large number of civilians swarming in.

Vita: They weren’t overlooked.

Vita: Paradise Wardens cannot be annihilated completely, so long as… Anyway, even if we wipe out all the Paradise Wardens, they’ll just respawn endlessly unless we find a way to resolve this disaster.

Griseo: You’re hiding something from us again. What is it?

Vita: Just a few minor details.

Vita: If given the chance, I could go on for days bombarding you with all the minutia of their origin story. Something tells me, however, that we don’t quite have that kind of time on our hands.

Griseo: You…

Griseo: …Never mind.

Griseo: Hua, I’ve noticed before that several security doors in this museum have been outfitted to be riot-resistant, just like in the Ark.

Griseo: If we can get all the monster corpses out of the door, we should be able to protect the exhibition hall from any further assaults.

Fu Hua: Okay, let’s split up and get to action.

Vita: See? Omitting a few key details won’t stop everyone from reaching the right conclusions.

Griseo: Oh, give me a break.

Fu Hua: All cleared.

Fu Hua: Let’s shut the security door.

…

Fu Hua: Griseo may have gone to the room next door.

Fu Hua: It’s Orange and the others. I should go check on them first.

Fred: Is this our new secret base? Cool.

Fred: Why hasn’t Boss come back yet? When are we getting a new assignment?

Ella: Now that Yellow… Ahem, the senior officer is here, we should follow her instructions.

Veracious Vita: Huh? When did I…

Encompassing Vita: Um… before Boss left, he told me to pass on a message, telling you all to remain here and stand by. This is a crucial covert operation. You are to remain inside the museum and not wander around, is that clear?

Veracious Vita: Oh, yes, right… Boss said… well, um…

Fu Hua: …What are you doing?

Fred: Oh, hey! Did Boss invite you over here?

Fu Hua: Huh?

Fu Hua was momentarily dazed. The Vitas kept winking at her, their expressions a blend of anxiousness and pleading.

Fu Hua: Uh… yes. He also asked me to let you know that you should follow the representatives’ directions and stand by at the base.

Fred: I knew Boss wouldn’t leave us behind!

Peter: Okay, let’s find a place to kick back… I mean, await Boss’ next instruction.

Finally, after reassuring the younger members, Yellow let out a sigh of relief.

Veracious Vita: That was close. Almost spilled the beans back there…

Fu Hua: Are you all trying to put the residents’ minds at ease?

Encompassing Vita: Yes, Fu… Fu Hua.

Encompassing Vita: They’ve just gone through a merciless onslaught, complete with monsters and flooding; fear and anxiety are both running high right now. We’re hoping to keep them as calm as possible.

Encompassing Vita: The only thing is that…

Her eyes grew dim.

Encompassing Vita: We’ve forgotten so many things, that they seem like strangers to us now.

Encompassing Vita: They could get pretty distraught if they realise this. And so, to avoid causing them any more distress, we have to pretend as if nothing has changed.

Veracious Vita: But to make it work, we must act as if we’re extremely familiar with them. I’ve told more lies today than I have in my entire life combined!

Veracious Vita: If we go on like this, we’ll be no better than the nastiest dregs of society. We might as well be supervillains at this rate!

Fu Hua: Relax. You’re doing it all in order to offer them a bit of solace. You’re not harming anyone with a few white lies.

Encompassing Vita: I guess you’re right. Besides, I think we did pretty well back there.

Veracious Vita: It’s just that…

Veracious Vita: They’re just kids, and they have no idea as to the extent of what’s befallen the city. If we could only somehow make them believe that it’s all just a game. Erm, that doesn’t seem quite right either.

Veracious Vita: …

Veracious Vita: Anyhow, this is the last lie! I’m never lying again, not even once!

…

Encompassing Vita: Unfortunately, now is not the time to be headstrong.

Meeting Fu Hua’s concerned gaze, Orange smiled reassuringly.

Encompassing Vita: Don’t worry, Yellow won’t leave anyone behind.

Encompassing Vita: Look…

Just a short distance away, a few residents stopped Veracious Vita to ask her about something. In response, she patiently answered their questions like an old acquaintance.

Encompassing Vita: Looks like Yellow might give herself away before long. I better go help her out. See you later.

Fu Hua: Yes, see you later.

Fu Hua watched as the Vitas walked away.

Even when they’ve suffered multiple setbacks and are feeling at a loss themselves, they’re still protecting this city in whatever way they can.

Fu Hua: (Protect, huh?)

Fu Hua: Is she calling me?

Ella: Sorry to bother you, Vitas’ friend.

Ella: Orange and Yellow were acting a bit strange earlier… They aren’t hurt, are they?

Fu Hua: Don’t worry, they’re fine. Just a bit tired.

Ella: That’s good. I’d hate to have them be injured from helping us narrowly escape the clutches of death. Please tell them that we’re all okay, and not to push themselves too hard.

Fu Hua: Huh? What are you talking about…?

Ella: Come on. You can drop the act around me. I’m not as naive as Fred and Pete, and I’m not foolish enough to believe those monsters and floods are just a special holiday performance.

Ella: Most of all, your acting left a bit to be desired.

Fu Hua: …

Ella: But I know how much effort Orange and Yellow put into all this.

Ella: If it would help lessen the stress put upon them, I’ll gladly continue playing the fool.

Ella: Besides, we’ll soon be bringing this situation to a close, won’t we?

Fu Hua: Yeah.

Even though the Little Vitas did not know the residents of Phosphorus anymore, the residents could tell they’d come with good intentions.

There is a mutual trust between both sides.

Ella: Oh right, could you please return this to Cyan?

Fu Hua: Is this the roll of film from before?

Ella: Blue said that if anything happened to Phosphorus, we should return it to you.

Ella: Cyan has always cherished his camera and the photos he takes. It should be returned to its rightful owner.

Fu Hua examined the small roll of film in her hand.

Fu Hua: This is…

Fu Hua: Blue had us use this roll of film for an exchange before… Did he foresee this?

Fu Hua clenched her hand around the roll of film. It felt weighty.

Fu Hua: Leave it to me.

Pondering Man: Orange said that we could go back home after the flood subsided.

Pondering Man: But when will the flood recede?

Blue and Green stared at the clock in the display case for a while, lost in thought.

Sensing Fu Hua’s approach, Blue turned around and nodded in greeting.

Mindful Vita: Hello, Fu Hua.

Mindful Vita: Purple told us about what happened in the forbidden area. We’re so sorry for doubting you before, and for getting in your way.

Fu Hua: It’s okay. Moriarty always liked to construct his lies using a distortion of the truth. As the city representatives, the more you care about Phosphorus, the easier it is to persuade you.

Disciplined Vita: Indeed.

Disciplined Vita: “We’re in a time loop.” - We had some doubts before, but we never expected him to say it with such confidence.

Disciplined Vita: For us, not only was he on the side of justice, but he was also the key to unveiling the truth.

Fu Hua: You’ve had suspicions about this for a while?

Disciplined Vita: I used to be a researcher, you know.

Disciplined Vita: I mean, at least in this cycle where I have memories, I used to be one.

Disciplined Vita: Back then, I… or rather, the whole of Phosphorus, was suffused with this desire to explore the world.

Disciplined Vita: However, the more we explored, the more mysteries arose. We were constantly speculating about how this world came to be and why these rules had been established.

Disciplined Vita: Miss Vita also entrusted me to place this broken clock in the museum. She seemed a bit perturbed at the time and said something strange.

Disciplined Vita: “Little Green,” she asked, “if this clock were disassembled and reassembled, would it still be the same clock?”

Mindful Vita: …

Disciplined Vita: I suppose it’s probably hard for Blue to imagine. Blue is much smarter than me, after all.

Disciplined Vita: Research can be an exercise in tedium at times, so you chose to help record the history of Phosphorus.

Mindful Vita: No, actually…

Mindful Vita: Not long ago, I had a similar vision. It was about storing the clock in the museum.

Disciplined Vita: …!

Mindful Vita: Maybe we’ll remember everything soon. But…

Mindful Vita: I’m sorry, Fu Hua. We still have no memory of you and Griseo.

Fu Hua: It’s okay. As long as you’re willing to entertain the notion that we were once partners, that’s enough.

Disciplined Vita: …Thank you.

The girl nodded with a hint of shyness.

Disciplined Vita: Apart from that, I also remembered some other things…

Fu Hua: …?

Disciplined Vita: I remember that, in our pursuit of greater truths, we delved quite extensively into mining technology, and the land in Phosphorus was becoming increasingly difficult to cultivate. The rivers were polluted, and had become muddy and unusable…

Disciplined Vita: Finally, one day, we decided to activate the Artifact. When we did, a flood came and razed everything we had built. We had advanced flood prevention measures, but we were completely powerless against this freak flood.

Disciplined Vita: I can’t remember what happened after that.

Mindful Vita: …

Disciplined Vita: What about you, Blue? How did the cycle in your memory end?

Mindful Vita: Pretty similar to your recollection. It’s just that, in that cycle, scientific development might have been slightly more delayed.

Mindful Vita: The heating equipment at the Phosphorus Metal Factory malfunctioned, causing a fire that burned down more than half the city. To save the residents who had been mortally wounded, we activated the Artifact, which triggered a massive flood.

Mindful Vita: The flood washed away the incinerated wreckage left by the fire… and also washed away all the other survivors in the city. Everywhere you turned, you could hear cries for help.

Mindful Vita: …

Mindful Vita: Our memories stopped at the moment the flood came… that’s the sign of the cycle, right?

Fu Hua didn’t answer.

Mindful Vita: …I see.

Mindful Vita: So, this time…

Fu Hua: Don’t worry, you didn’t activate the Artifact this time. Everything will be different.

Fu Hua: And…

Fu Hua: Where I come from, various disasters have occurred in the past. Hurricanes, wildfires, freezing blizzards… All of which claimed untold amounts of lives.

Fu Hua: But our civilisation didn’t stop. Even the Finality brought by the Honkai didn’t have the power to deprive everyone of their future.

Fu Hua: Living through this experience has led me to the conclusion that even the smallest amount of resistance, when built up, has the power to create a brand-new world.

Fu Hua: You see, since Griseo and I have appeared, the future has undergone some subtle changes, has it not?

Blue stared at Fu Hua in astonishment.

For the first time, the typically composed and thoughtful boy exhibited an expression that actually matched his childish appearance: one of bewilderment.

Mindful Vita: …Is that so?

Fu Hua: Of course, it’s a promise.

Fu Hua: So long as we’re here, we won’t let the flood destroy your home.

Optimistic Man: Blue and the others provided emergency food and water for everyone, so it’s okay if we stay a few more days in the museum.

Optimistic Man: Reliable as always, just as city representatives should be.

Harmonious Vita: Fu Hua.

Fu Hua: What are you looking at, Purple?

Harmonious Vita: Miss Vita went out of her way to bring us this exhibit.

Harmonious Vita: We had just become city representatives, and our schedules were jam-packed. Only when we were with Miss Vita did we ever have a chance to relax.

Harmonious Vita: But Miss Vita always had somewhere she had to be, so the time we could spend with her was limited.

Harmonious Vita: She was worried that we would feel lonely, so she would always bring us all sorts of interesting curios, this flower being one of them.

Harmonious Vita: Or maybe it’s not a flower? Miss Vita always was a practical joker.

Fu Hua: I can see that being the case.

Harmonious Vita: Miss Vita told us that there are flowers that can detect lies, and that can discern the depth of emotions… We all wanted to see them.

Harmonious Vita: But Miss Vita refused.

Harmonious Vita: She said: “How can primitive plants understand the complexity of human nature and emotions? Don’t take it so seriously.”

Harmonious Vita: “We are not simplistic organisms programmed with set rules. We are not plants in a hothouse. We have to see and think for ourselves. Only then can we understand the meaning of life and gain true freedom.”

Harmonious Vita: To this day, I’m not entirely sure what she was getting at… Haven’t we always been free?

Harmonious Vita: What do you think that Miss Vita was trying to tell us, Fu Hua?

Fu Hua: …

Looking at the plant, Fu Hua saw what seemed to be a devilish grin, one rather reminiscent of the one Vita always had plastered across her face.

However, the Vita she had encountered was quite different from this girl’s description.

Harmonious Vita: …

Harmonious Vita: Fu Hua, I have this odd feeling… Did Miss Vita change in some way? Did we do something to disappoint her?

Harmonious Vita: In each of the cycles I remember, Miss Vita would always wake us up in the beginning. She named us and told us our identities…

Harmonious Vita: But if she knows about the cycles, why wouldn’t she tell us?

Fu Hua: She…

Fu Hua: Sorry, I don’t know either.

Fu Hua: Maybe she didn’t want to hurt you, or maybe she had other motives… To be perfectly honest, my understanding of her is quite superficial, and I can’t pretend to know what is going on inside her mind.

Harmonious Vita: I have sensed a strong premonition that Miss Vita is going to do something utterly amazing, but at the same time, exceptionally difficult. So difficult that we can’t even imagine it.

Harmonious Vita: I wish she would tell us.

Harmonious Vita: We may not be able to help her, but we don’t want to be kept in the dark and end up getting in her way.

Harmonious Vita: After all, we’re…

She hesitated and used a word that felt somewhat unfamiliar to her.

Harmonious Vita: …We’re family.

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua remained silent.

She could utter encouraging promises of how they could overcome whatever lay ahead, but she found it difficult to make such statements with any real conviction.

Fu Hua: (What are these children to you, Vita?)

Worried Woman: It feels like something’s gotten into Red today. She didn’t respond to my greeting with her usual energy. It seems that this disaster has hit her hard.

Righteous Vita: I’ve been fine for a while now, Cyan. Go help Orange and the others.

Righteous Vita: Apart from that, I think I should tell Miss Vita about the box we found in the storeroom earlier.

Erudite Vita: Very well, Little Red, but for now, I want to stay here with you.

Erudite Vita: If you have something on your mind, you can talk to me.

Righteous Vita: You’re as caring as ever, Cyan… But you used to just call me Red.

Erudite Vita: Haha, really? Sorry, I can’t remember much from before…

Fu Hua: Hey, you two.

Erudite Vita: Oh, hey Fu Hua.

Erudite Vita greeted Fu Hua casually.

Although not long ago, she had been an entirely new face to him, he never felt nervous or awkward talking to her.

It was as if they had known each other for a long time.

Erudite Vita: Do you need something?

Fu Hua: I’m here to return this to its rightful owner.

Fu Hua handed him the roll of film along with the camera which had been broken earlier.

Fu Hua: Apologies, Griseo said the camera was damaged beyond repair.

Fu Hua: I’ll ask her to assemble a new camera for you after the flood is resolved.

Erudite Vita: …?

Fu Hua: You might not remember, but you used to carry this camera with you all the time. You broke it during the confrontation with Moriarty in order to leave me an important clue.

Cyan stared at the item in his hand. Although he was positive he had never laid hands on this camera before, he nonetheless felt an inexplicably strong connection to it.

While still in a daze, his hand instinctively opened the disposable film roll.

Erudite Vita: …?!

He had no recollection of any of the events portrayed on the film negative. One of the photos showed him, Orange, Red, and Fu Hua bunched close together, each of them beaming with happiness.

It was a photo taken before they had entered the forbidden area, a final souvenir left by Mindful Vita to help awaken their memories.

The Vitas stared at the photo in astonishment.

Righteous Vita: …

Erudite Vita: We took this photo together? I have no memory of it at all.

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: It’s okay. Even if our memories fade, the friendships forged from those memories never will.

Erudite Vita: Yeah! That’s why as soon as I saw you, I felt this instant sense of closeness. Didn’t you feel the same, Little Red… I mean, Red?

Righteous Vita: …

Fu Hua: What’s wrong? Did you get hurt helping the residents earlier?

Righteous Vita: I’m fine. You must be exhausted after tussling with all those monsters. You should go rest for a while, Fu Hua.

Righteous Vita: I… I’ll be fine here on my own.

Fu Hua: …?

Erudite Vita: When we were distributing emergency supplies, Red said something that rubbed someone the wrong way, and they got into an argument. After that, she’s been pretty down in the dumps…

Righteous Vita: You didn’t have to bring that up, Cyan. I’m fine.

Righteous Vita: Just leave me be.

Fu Hua: Is it because you’ve forgotten everyone in the city?

Righteous Vita: …

Righteous Vita: Fu Hua, why aren’t you giving me a dressing down? This is all because I trusted Moriarty. It’s all my fault.

Fu Hua: It’s not. You simply lost your memories, that’s all.

Righteous Vita: So… as long as I don’t remember, my mistakes can be forgiven?

Fu Hua: …

Righteous Vita: Why did it have to turn out like this? I promised to protect Phosphorus.

Righteous Vita: I remember everyone’s names and habits so clearly. I’ve always been with them.

Righteous Vita: But everything is different now.

Red clenched her teeth, trying not to show any weakness. Her hands trembled as if she was trying to hold onto something that no longer existed.

Righteous Vita: It’s all my fault. If I were stronger, smarter, maybe I wouldn’t have lost my memories, and Phosphorus wouldn’t be like this now.

Righteous Vita: But now, when everyone needs me the most… All I can do is hide here and cower, afraid that they’ll discover I’m not the same Red I used to be. I am too afraid of seeing the unfamiliarity and surprise in their eyes.

Righteous Vita: I’m scared that I’ll make the same mistakes as before and hurt them all over again.

Righteous Vita: I’m no longer the Red they once knew. All I’ll do is disappoint them…

Erudite Vita: Red…

Fu Hua: You are always yourself.

Fu Hua: Red, is there something you want to do?

Righteous Vita: Me? Continue protecting Phosphorus, of course. But… I might not be able to do it now.

Fu Hua: Even when you don’t recognise the people in the city anymore?

Righteous Vita: Yeah. As a city representative, I must protect everyone, no matter the circumstances.

Fu Hua: What about you, Cyan? Are you willing to trust Red now?

Erudite Vita: Of course. Red hasn’t changed at all. She’s the same ol’ Red I’ve always known.

Fu Hua: You see? Your desires, the people you want to protect, your friends, everything is still the same.

Fu Hua: Even if your memories are gone, you’re still you.

Righteous Vita: …

Fu Hua: Eighteen years ago, I lost many memories and forgot many things I shouldn’t have; I suffered and did a lot of bad things because of it.

Fu Hua: But on the other hand, across a much longer timespan, amongst the thousands of years of my life… I have been plagued by chaotic memories, both unable to resolve the past or predict the future.

Fu Hua: Honestly, I’m not the sharpest knife in the drawer. I had to go through a lot of experiences for it to get through that thick skull of mine that… all past experiences have left their mark on my life, regardless of whether I have my memories or not.

Fu Hua: My memories have shaped me, but they don’t define me entirely.

Fu Hua: Maybe this is all a bit hard for you to understand. That’s okay. Someday, you’ll get it.

The girl nodded thoughtfully.

Righteous Vita: Thank you, Fu Hua.

Righteous Vita: You’ve given me a lot to think about.

Fu Hua: You’re welcome.

Gameplay 42-6 - Getting Closer to the Truth

Meanwhile, in another room connected to the museum exhibition hall…

Griseo: Vita, aren’t you going to say something?

Vita: What should I say?

Vita: About Phosphorus and the lovely city representatives. I’ve already told you everything.

Griseo: …

Vita: Alright, alright. There are some things I’ve only told your dear Fu Hua. We’ve known each other longer, after all.

Vita: If you’re curious, go ask her. My heart may be in it, but I detest having to repeat myself.

Griseo: Don’t beat around the bush.

Griseo: Why did you keep the truth about Phosphorus and Hesperus’ origins from the Little Vitas?

Vita: …

Vita: I haven’t kept anything from them, at least not deliberately. It’s simply that not everyone needs to know everything.

Vita: In a utopian paradise, the angelic city representatives would live a life of bliss… just like how a fairy tale ought to be.

Griseo: But despite this, Phosphorus was unable to extricate itself from its fate, and was destroyed every time.

Griseo: Given that they’re the fulcrum upon which the Cycle Experiment is based, do they not deserve to know why they must go through all this?

Griseo: You clearly had the opportunity to rescue them from this cycle, so why didn’t you? Why did you instead sit idly by and watch from the sidelines?

Vita: Rescue… ha.

Vita: You’re oversimplifying everything.

Vita: Imagine this: one day, you find a suitable planet and establish a new civilisation using samples from the Ark’s gene bank. In such a situation, if extraterrestrial life were to hijack it, overturn it, and twist it beyond recognition, what would you do?

Griseo: …

Griseo: Don’t change the subject. This is the most extreme of all hypotheticals.

Vita: All things in this world skew towards the extreme.

Vita: This entire area is an experiment, one carefully orchestrated by a counterfeit creator. They won’t let anyone interfere, and I don’t have the power to challenge the creator. Besides…

Vita: I bear no allegiance to them. I’m in no way duty-bound to do this. Yes, we are all city representatives, but that’s all.

Griseo: How could you…

Vita: Am I wrong? Would you really give everything for someone simply because they have the slightest of connections with you, or because they said a few sentences that resonated with you?

Vita: I possess neither the loyalty nor the ability to do that, and I advise you to banish such childish thoughts from your mind as well.

Vita: As Moriarty mentioned, it is precisely because these representatives are so pure and innocent that they see either good or evil.

Vita: Once my actions seem to contradict their ideals, I will cease to be seen as a Vita and instead be regarded as an enemy who threatens the city.

Vita: Isn’t this current situation a perfect example? They almost turned against me because of Moriarty’s mendacity.

Griseo: …

Vita: So, instead of continuing to worry about matters of such little consequence, it’s better to think about what Moriarty is up to.

Griseo: What else could he be planning? He’s deliberately deceiving the Little Vitas, causing this city to fall into turmoil, all just to provoke you and make you suffer.

Griseo: This is all one giant act of retribution against you.

Vita: …I see.

Vita: Then he’s sorely mistaken. As you just noticed, whatever they go through has nothing to do with me. I have no intention of sympathising with them.

Vita: How could any of their hardships cause me to feel pain?

Griseo: Vita, you…

Griseo: They trust you more than anyone in the world. Don’t you feel anything at all for their misfortune?

Vita: No. Guilt is for fools and cowards, and I am neither.

Griseo: …

Griseo: I see. You’re right, now is not the time to discuss this.

Griseo: However, once everything in Phosphorus settles down, I will reveal to them who you truly are.

Vita: *sigh* Why do people always treat those who are honest so callously? Do they prefer hypocrisy over truth?

Vita: What do you think, Fu Hua?

Fu Hua: The Little Vitas are not the type to waver and forget old friendships.

Fu Hua: They have demonstrated no small amount of remorse for having placed so much trust in Moriarty.

Vita: …

Vita: Is that so?

Vita: But what does that have to do with me?

Fu Hua: …

Vita: Let us pivot this conversation to a more productive topic. Moriarty is on the run now, and he might become an even bigger thorn in our side.

Vita: You and he are old acquaintances, so you probably better understand how he operates.

Griseo: How did you manage to defeat him before, Hua?

Fu Hua: Moriarty’s Soulium body had developed to an astonishing degree, which made him a real challenge to deal with. To avoid the side effects of using Fenghuang Down’s power, I had to use a special device specifically designed to counter Soulium, and managed to incapacitate him.

Fu Hua: But later, due to various circumstances, I handed that device over to Welt Joyce, the 1st Herrscher of this era. The Moriarty in the museum now is different from the past, however, so any methods used previously are null and void to us now.

Griseo: It is true; he is just a holo-projection, and his true whereabouts remain as elusive as ever. If he plans to remain hidden, we could be in for a world of trouble.

Fu Hua: No, I know him. He won’t remain in the shadows forever. He’ll take further action.

Griseo: But the city is already on the brink of destruction. What could his next target possibly be?

Griseo: Could it be that Moriarty’s true target is the mastermind behind all this?

Fu Hua: It’s possible. The more chaotic the situation, the easier it might be for him to slip past us unnoticed. This could be the perfect time for this so-called Creator to make an appearance.

Vita: You’re a real whiz when it comes to analysing these things.

Griseo: However, even if Moriarty wants to do something, he has to approach them first.

Ignoring Vita’s comment, Griseo continued her thoughts.

Griseo: What’s the connection between the mastermind and Phosphorus?

Griseo: Apart from the representatives, there’s only…

She exchanged a glance with Fu Hua.

…The Ark.

Griseo: Ever since the flood began, there have been strange pillars of light rising from the Ark.

Griseo: But with all the floodwater outside, it’s not a good idea to be leaving the museum anytime soon.

Fu Hua: Vita, do you have any ideas?

Vita: Hmm? Now you remember me?

Vita shrugged, looking as if she had nothing to offer.

Fu Hua: Let’s go ask the Vitas. They’ve spent the most time with Moriarty, so they might know something.

Fu Hua: Ah, there they are.

Red was the first to notice their arrival.

Righteous Vita: Miss Vita! Griseo!

Griseo: What are you all talking about?

Disciplined Vita: We’re sharing our memories to try and find a solution to the flood.

Veracious Vita: Although our memories are incomplete, the more we discuss things, the more we’re starting to remember various events from our individual cycles.

Griseo: Speaking of which, we have something we’d like to ask you.

Righteous Vita: Okay, shoot. There’s no one who understands Phosphorus better than us.

Fu Hua and Griseo told the Little Vitas about their recent discussion regarding Moriarty. After hearing their question, the Little Vitas looked at each other with visible confusion, then proceeded to shake their heads.

Mindful Vita: Moriarty was rather interested in the forbidden area before, and he obtained the authorisation to enter it. He also retrieved the hibernation device that had trapped Griseo.

Mindful Vita: But other than that, we didn’t find anything else.

Fu Hua: So, whatever his ultimate goal is, it doesn’t lie within the forbidden area.

Erudite Vita: Right. During our discussion, we noticed something strange.

Griseo: Strange?

Erudite Vita: Yes. Based on our recollections, the museum has always existed and been located beneath the central square of the city.

Erudite Vita: However, the Hesperus which was subjected to natural disasters was in a different place from today’s Phosphorus. How is that possible?

Griseo: Could it be that the real museum isn’t located where Phosphorus is now?

Griseo: Every time I entered the museum, I felt kinda dizzy, like I’d just ridden in one of Vill-V’s ejection devices.

Fu Hua: …?

Fu Hua: Why didn’t I…

Fu Hua: …Oh.

Fu Hua: Could it be that because I’m a holo-projection now, I couldn’t feel the presence of a teleportation device at the museum’s entrance?

Fu Hua: It seems a bit of a stretch, but it would explain how the museum has remained protected from the floodwaters, despite being underground.

Griseo: If that’s the case, where is the museum actually located?

Griseo: It’d have to be a place in Phosphorus that isn’t affected by the flood, or somewhere that can be hermetically sealed…

Griseo: …

They exchanged another glance.

Fu Hua & Griseo: The Ark!

Never in their wildest dreams did they expect that they would already be in the interior of the Ark while not having even attempted to locate it.

But…

At that moment, there was a sudden burst of applause from the side.

Vita: Such a bold and carefully thought-out deduction.

Vita: Congratulations on finding the ladder that leads closer to the truth of Phosphorus. Well done!

Vita: Let me give you a little reward.

Fu Hua: What…?

Vita: I recall a legend from one of the bubble universes I’ve explored.

Vita: An oracle, fleeing from the depths of despair, dreamed of a ladder leading to the sky. He ascended it and reached the abode of the Creator.

Vita: That is what we call Vita’s Ladder. Simply climb up, and you will meet the Creator.

Fu Hua: …

Vita: Haha, just kidding. It’s only the gangway leading to the Ark.

Vita: Are you surprised? Bet you didn’t expect that!

Griseo: Vita, you…

Griseo: How many more secrets are you hiding from us?

Vita: Shh…

Vita: This isn’t really a secret anymore. Ever since you all went and mentioned it, it’s gone on to become fairly common knowledge.

Fu Hua: …?

Fu Hua: (Indeed… I discovered Griseo… Moriarty investigated the world’s secrets… and only when we deduced that the museum might belong to the Ark, did she pretend to show us the way.)

Fu Hua: (She didn’t voluntarily reveal any secrets to us, that much is true.)

Fu Hua: Vita, are you still bound by some kind of… let’s say, “limitation” from the Creator? Is there anything preventing you from disclosing the truth of this planet to us?

Vita: Maybe. Who knows?

Fu Hua: …

Vita’s smile remained unchanged. Fu Hua looked at that ever-playful face for a while before eventually giving up.

Fu Hua: Alright, let’s go.

Vita: That’s right. Time is precious. You mustn’t waste it in a place like this.

Vita: Let’s go!

Griseo: Hua…

Fu Hua: It’s okay, I’ll take the lead.

As Fu Hua was about to climb the ladder…

A small hand suddenly tugged on her pants leg.

Righteous Vita: Are you going to find a way to save Phosphorus, Fu Hua?

Righteous Vita: Can we go with you?

--

Gameplay 42-7 - Ultimate Act

The request from the Little Vitas took the three of them by surprise. Even Vita, who always acted aloof, flashed a look of disapproval.

Vita: Little Red, this is not the time to be reckless.

Vita: Implicating oneself into a situation that doesn’t suit you might lead to trouble.

Righteous Vita: But…

Griseo: The place we are going to is forbidden for you to tread on. Having said that, amongst the chaos and confusion of this flood, those rules may no longer apply…

Griseo: Nevertheless, should we encounter any formidable foes during our exploration, we won’t have enough manpower to protect you.

Righteous Vita: Griseo, we don’t need protection!

Righteous Vita: We are the guardians of Phosphorus, and we will protect it however we see fit.

Griseo: But being a guardian doesn’t mean you have to rush headlong into every situation.

Griseo: Sometimes the best way to fulfill your duty as a guardian is to let your comrades lead the charge.

Griseo: That’s not a sign of weakness.

Griseo: Moreover, you're still in charge of looking after everyone. You better stay in the museum.

…

The Little Vitas looked at each other, and after what seemed to be a few moments of hesitation among them, Red stepped forward.

Righteous Vita: We didn’t make this decision on a whim.

The girl’s eyes were bright, and she looked at Fu Hua and the others with the same earnestness as when they first met.

Righteous Vita: We know we’re not as strong or as smart as any of you, but we are duty-bound as representatives.

Righteous Vita: Our memories, in which we have safeguarded Phosphorus, go back centuries, and we can’t bear to watch Phosphorus be destroyed by this flood.

Righteous Vita: Someday, somehow, we’ll find a way to be useful.

Righteous Vita: Even if our contribution may not be as much compared to you.

Righteous Vita: There might be something we can do that you can’t.

Fu Hua: …

Righteous Vita: And one more thing.

Righteous Vita: Miss Vita, we’ve been protected all this time and didn’t know anything, so we made a big mistake.

Righteous Vita: Even though we understand that you must have had a special reason for doing this.

Righteous Vita: This time, we want to fight alongside you.

Righteous Vita: At least give us the chance.

Vita: …

Vita didn’t answer. She looked at the seven children in front of her who all bore the same name, her expression changing constantly.

After a moment, she smiled lightly.

Vita: You’ve all gone awfully serious all of a sudden.

Vita: You’ve always been the city’s representatives. I would never treat you like children. You have the right to choose.

Vita: However, the Ark belongs to Griseo. Whether we take you with us or not is her decision to make.

Griseo: Hua, it should be your decision. You've spent more time with them.

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua’s gaze shifted between the Little Vitas for a moment… each with the same face bearing the same determined expression.

After a while, she nodded at Griseo.

Fu Hua: Let’s go together then. But remember, don’t stray too far, or else we won’t be able to protect you.

Fu Hua: Let’s work together to restore peace to Phosphorus.

Vitas: YEEEAAAH!

With determination and courage in their hearts, Fu Hua and her group climbed the ladder leading to the Ark…

Righteous Vita: Wow, we’ve really inside.

Vita: How does it feel, Griseo?

Vita: Seeing the Ark again after all these years.

Griseo: …Not good.

Griseo: I suppose nobody would be particularly stoked at seeing their home occupied by uninvited guests.

Vita: Huh, I figured Griseo wouldn’t care about that sort of thing.

Fu Hua: The Paradise Wardens have appeared on the Ark as well…

Fu Hua: Let’s look around for clues.

Fu Hua: Wait, that’s…

Challenge Letter

J.M.

The messenger from paradise brings a letter of challenge:

Will tonight’s scapegoat be a mockingbird or a cuckoo?

The condolence meeting for the defeated gambler will commence after the bell rings.


Griseo: A challenge letter?

Fu Hua: Moriarty. Looks like he got here ahead of us.

Griseo: Regardless of what his aim is, isn’t he making it harder on himself by leaving behind clues like this?

Fu Hua: Moriarty views all his crimes as a performance. If he left no clues, the entertainment value of his performance would plummet in his eyes.

Fu Hua: As a result, we can’t rule out the possibility that this letter is all part of his plan to manipulate us.

Veracious Vita: What a huge platform.

Griseo: This used to be the bridge of the Ark. During the voyage, if I wasn’t in dormancy, I would spend most of my time here.

Encompassing Vita: All by yourself? Didn’t that get lonely?

Griseo: The pursuit of arts and engineering has always been a solitary venture.

Griseo: Also, that damaged wall over there used to have a large porthole. Whenever I didn't have any other tasks to attend to, I would stay by the window and look at the stars.

Harmonious Vita: The stars must have been beautiful, unlike Phosphorus with its two hazy moons and nothing else.

Griseo: Yes, it was resplendent.

Griseo: But a bit monotonous after a while.

Griseo: It was like I was the only person in the whole wide universe.

Fu Hua: …

The Little Vitas blinked, not entirely sure if they fully understood.

For them, who had never set foot outside Phosphorus, the universe was somewhat outside the scope of their thought process.

Encompassing Vita: It’s okay, Griseo. Now you've got everyone from Phosphorus behind you.

Encompassing Vita: You’re not alone anymore.

Griseo: You’re right.

Vita: The view here is nice, but unfortunately, the weather isn’t so great right now.

Erudite Vita: Aaaah…

Harmonious Vita: Is that Phosphorus down there? How did it get like this…

Fu Hua: (The flood is getting more serious. We need to find a solution as soon as possible.)

Righteous Vita: Look, what’s that?

Flood Report 1

Reporter: Proxy

Record Date: ▇▇ - ▇▇ - ▇▇

The person who made me write this report has probably forgotten the meaning of “words”. Since this is a report that no one will read, I’ll write it in my usual tone of voice.

Today, a flood broke out in Phosphorus.

Now the water level is higher than the tallest building in the city; I’m afraid it won’t be long before it claims the people who have taken refuge on the roofs.

I hear muffled cries for help, and hoarse screams…

Yet louder still was the roar of floodwater.

Only those who were there would understand what a saddening sound it was.

The water roared all night long. After it finally stopped, I picked up half of a woodblock in the muddy street, the writing on it too washed out to read.

It might have been an aphorism, a love quote, or a summary of human history.

But now, it’s just a chunk of wood.


Righteous Vita: Proxy?

Righteous Vita: So Phosphorus had other representatives apart from us?

Harmonious Vita: From the descriptions in the file, it seems she also went through the flood… She was alone and must have been very scared.

Disciplined Vita: If that’s true, how come she’s so calm?

Harmonious Vita: Also, unless I’m mistaken, judging from the stuff written near the end, could she have survived the flood?

Veracious Vita: That’s fantastic! So the great flood didn’t take everyone. Could this be the person who established the new Phosphorus?

…

While the Little Vitas enthusiastically discussed amongst themselves, the faces of the other three were decidedly more morose.

Griseo: Are those your notes, Vita?

Griseo: They’re enveloped in your color.

Vita: Who knows?

Recalling the memories of Vita she had chanced upon in the past, Fu Hua suddenly understood what had happened.

???: Hello, nice to meet you. I’m…

???: I’m…

???: …

???: Sorry. Do you know my name?

Me: I’m afraid I don’t.

???: What… what should I call you?

Me: Me?

Me: My name is Vita. Nice to meet you.

Me: As for your name… I can come up with one for you. If you don’t mind, that is.

???: Really? Thank you, Miss Vita!

Me: You’re welcome. I’m really good at coming up with names.

Fu Hua: (Could it be that the responsibility of the Guider also includes destruction?)

Fu Hua: (Vita, is that the reason you’re here?)

Erudite Vita: I wonder what kind of person this representative is…

Veracious Vita: Look, there are more lost notes over there!

Flood Report 2

Reporter: Proxy

Record Date: ▇▇ - ▇▇ - ▇▇

That being has really abandoned speech and words and can only speak telepathically inside my head. If we go by certain schools of philosophy, She has probably lost the opportunity to articulate the truth… or maybe She is the Truth, who knows?

This time the flood came especially late, so late that I wondered if the seeds She planted had blossomed at all.

But the day still came. The floodwater scoured the land that was overmined to barrenness, mixing with rivers filled with chemical effluents… perhaps even without this disaster, this “home” had little time left.

On the other hand, they did come out a little stronger than in previous reincarnations.

The flood failed to take away the dregs of civilisation, so I awakened the Paradise Wardens.

The cries drowned out the sound of the waves… I’ve grown tired of it all.

When will this senseless cycling end?


Veracious Vita: It can’t be…

Mindful Vita: It’s the flood that we all experienced…

Righteous Vita: Could it be that whoever wrote these notes also went through the cycle like us? But there were only seven of us…

Disciplined Vita: Could they have been a resident of the city?

Mindful Vita: No, there’s another possibility.

Fu Hua: Blue, you…

Mindful Vita ignored Fu Hua’s look of uncertainty and slowly pressed on.

Mindful Vita: Perhaps this representative isn’t a guardian of the city. Perhaps they’re the one who has brought disaster to Phosphorus.

Harmonious Vita: How… how could…

Veracious Vita: No, it’s impossible!

The Little Vitas looked at each other in disbelief, rendered speechless.

…!

Fu Hua: Strange, these Paradise Wardens seem to have appeared nearly instantaneously.

Fu Hua: Is there some kind of pattern…?

Righteous Vita: Wait, there’s something over there…

Flood Report 3

Reporter: Proxy

Record Date: ▇▇ - ▇▇ - ▇▇

How many floods have there been? Can’t remember.

No matter how shiny this city looks, in my eyes, it has never lived.

Death, rebirth, and then destruction again.

The unchanging sound of the water is like an urging.

“It’s about time for something different.”


After reading the new notes, the silence amongst the Little Vitas became even more oppressive.

The notion that this world operated according to principles which were purely malevolent in nature had never entered their minds before, let alone that they would be key figures situated right in the center of these principles.

Vita watched them from a distance, raising an eyebrow.

Vita: See? The truth can be quite unsparing at times.

Griseo: What exactly are you up to?

Vita: Shh… it’s a secret.

Vita: I’ll tell you when the time is right.

Griseo clearly wasn’t satisfied with her response, but before she could say anything…

The Paradise Wardens surrounded them once again.

Griseo: There’s a way ahead now.

Vita: You’ve certainly got a unique way of clearing a path, Griseo.

Fu Hua: Let’s check it out.

Griseo: This is the Ark’s communicator. It took a few bumps during the crash landing, but wasn’t damaged.

…

The communicator suddenly emitted a signal indicating a connection. Griseo and Fu Hua exchanged glances.

Following that, a figure exuding no small amount of pomposity appeared on the screen.

Moriarty: Well, well, if it isn’t the Great Detective. I’ve been waiting here for quite some time.

Moriarty: You took longer than expected. I presume that has to do with the little tagalongs?

Moriarty: You see, that’s the disadvantage of being one of the good guys; there’s always someone or something dragging you down.

Moriarty: I’m currently at the top of the Ark, a place which you cannot reach.

Moriarty: And this time…

Moriarty: I hope we can reach a peaceful resolution.

Moriarty: Let’s set aside our differences and teach Sa a lesson, shall we?

Fu Hua: Do you really think we’re buying a single line of what you’re saying?

Fu Hua’s reaction seemed to be precisely what Moriarty had expected, and he laughed dismissively.

Moriarty: No matter. Cooperate or not, the choice is mine, not yours.

Moriarty: I tried every means to contact the Creator before you entered the Ark.

Moriarty: See that? That looming entity faintly visible beyond the clouds? That is merely one of its limbs. Quite massive, isn’t it?

Moriarty: I’ve tried many ways to approach it, but unfortunately, it seems to be under the protection of something whose nature surpasses that of this planet.

Moriarty: I even tried to fly up high, but due to what I can only assume is insufficient, shall we say, “authorisation”, I was unable to get even a millimeter closer.

Moriarty: There is, however, one last method which I have yet to try, which is also the most brazen. That is why I have come to you, extending an olive branch.

Moriarty: In one minute, I will touch the pillar of light before me, which is comprised of pure energy from the Creator.

Fu Hua: …!

Fu Hua: Are you planning on killing yourself?

Moriarty: I can see why you might be led to that conclusion. Anyone who touches the light pillar will be instantly vaporised. Completely disintegrated at the molecular level.

Moriarty: However, because I happen to be a holo-projection in the museum, there is another possibility. Using the pillar of light as a conduit, I will return to the source of this energy.

Moriarty: I presume you wish to know the likelihood of this plan succeeding?

Moriarty: Unfortunately, not even I can provide an accurate calculation at this point in time.

Fu Hua: …

Moriarty: I can see the shock and disbelief one your faces, and I understand completely. It is truly the gamble to end all gambles.

Moriarty: How exciting! No crime could compare to this kind of rush!

Moriarty: As for you, Fu Hua…

Moriarty: It’s a shame our reunion has to be cut short. We haven’t had a chance to properly catch up as old friends should.

Moriarty: But it doesn’t matter; you’ll soon witness my magnificent performance, which is more profound than an eternity of words could hope to be. Though I don’t know the odds…

Moriarty: Just as in the past, I will not die until I have completed a truly magnificent caper.

Moriarty: Well then, time waits for no one. Let’s offer the art of finality to that arrogant “God”.

Fu Hua: Wait, Moriarty.

Moriarty: My apologies, Great Detective, but this time, we really do have to say goodbye.

And so, like an ephemeral firework, the life of the renowned criminal scholar burst with a resplendent grandeur for but a moment, then all fell into silence once again.

The Napoleon of the criminal world, the unparalleled artist, seemed to have shuffled off this mortal coil and become the stuff of legend, the gloomy sky above now his eternal abode.

--

Gameplay 42-8 - Beginning Moment

A little over ten minutes ago, a criminal who fancied himself an artist delivered his farewell address and then vanished before the eyes of the public.

After that, Fu Hua’s group conducted a brief search and regrouped on the bridge.

Fu Hua: There’s no sign of Moriarty anywhere.

Disciplined Vita: We haven’t found anything on our end either.

Righteous Vita: Hmph, in the name of the representatives, if that fiend dares to show his face around here again, he’ll have hell to pay!

Griseo: I don’t think he’ll be coming back, at least not for a while.

Griseo: I quickly checked all possible entrances and exits in the Ark and didn’t find any colors resembling Moriarty’s.

Griseo: His characteristics are quite memorable, so for me to overlook them should not be possible.

Vita: I never cease to be amazed by your ability, Griseo. As for me, fortunately I haven’t done any illegal hacking or anything like that, or I’d be too ashamed to stand here amongst your ranks.

Griseo: However, from what I’ve observed, there are traces of you coming and going plastered everywhere in the Ark.

Griseo: I guess that would be because you told me that wandering around the place while I was in dormancy was perfectly acceptable.

Vita: Griseo can be quite stern sometimes. All of that was for work, after all. What’s there to feel guilty about?

Griseo: …

Fu Hua: (Work…)

Mindful Vita: Anyway, now that Moriarty has essentially gone entirely off the grid, can we assume that he’s really gone?

Vita: There’s no need to mince words when talking about such a dastardly villain, Little Blue. He’s dead. Although, since he’s an exhibit, would it not be more accurate to say that he’s broken?

Vita: The energy that the “God” uses to destroy the world is exceedingly powerful. Even if it’s a data-based entity like him, if I were to approach it, I would be instantly incinerated… and I’m not just saying that as a scare tactic.

Fu Hua: I don’t think Moriarty would recklessly choose self-destruction. This was a decision he came to based on rational analysis.

Fu Hua: He either hasn’t truly been annihilated in every sense of the word, or he used some kind of illusion. Whatever the case, he is still moving towards his goal, of that I have no doubt.

Vita: That’s a tough nut to crack.

Griseo: And it’s a nut that you picked up willingly.

Vita: Haha, right.

Fu Hua: As intriguing as it is, trying to make sense of Moriarty’s plans isn’t our top priority right now. As he said before he disappeared, the impending apocalypse orchestrated by Sa is the biggest threat at the moment.

Fu Hua: All we need to do is remain wary of Moriarty while we consider how to counter Sa. Otherwise, we might lose sight of the bigger picture.

Fu Hua: That being said, being the enemy of our enemy doesn’t necessarily make them our friend. Never forget that, and don’t allow yourself to fall into anyone’s trap.

Griseo: I agree with Fu Hua.

Disciplined Vita: Indeed.

Harmonious Vita: As long as we can protect Phosphorus… we’ll do our best to help!

Mindful Vita: Alright, what’s our move now? Miss Vita’s saying none of us can go toe-to-toe with that Sa.

Fu Hua: Yeah…

Fu Hua: When push comes to shove, maybe I can pull out “that one form”... but relying on that entirely won’t make up for how much more energy Sa has than us.

Fu Hua: (Besides, what if…?)

Fu Hua: I guess we should start by finding out Sa’s weakness.

Righteous Vita: Weakness?

Fu Hua: Yes. Our adversary might claim to be a god, but they have been curiously restrained, and haven’t meddled in our endeavors or tampered with our cognitions. In the past cycle, their transcendental intervention was solely in response to the Artifact being summoned, which triggered a cataclysmic flood.

Fu Hua: Maybe they’ve got a personal agenda, or they were just sticking to some rulebook… But either way, until they unveil their true power, we’ve got time to find their Achilles’ Heel.

Griseo: Just like the martial arts back in Fu Hua’s hometown. We can target their weakness and use their own momentum against them, right?

Fu Hua: Haha, I didn’t think you’d still remember that, Griseo.

Griseo and Fu Hua exchanged a knowing nod before Griseo turned her attention to Vita.

Griseo: …

Vita: Erm, what are you guys staring at? Like I said before, I’m just a hapless holo-projection trapped in a candy shell. There’s not much I can do to help you out of here, unfortunately.

Griseo: Speaking of which, have you got any leads on Sa’s weakness?

Vita: Sorry, nope. Like I said before, the Creator and I weren’t exactly best buddies.

Vita: You’ve got my massive stack of reports, right? They dumped all that work on me… I’m starting to think they see me as a slave.

Fu Hua: But you didn’t exactly plan on spilling the beans until we stumbled upon these records. And earlier, when we discovered the link between the Ark and the museum, you only confirmed it after we’d started to work it out.

Vita: Hey, don’t blame me for not mentioning it sooner. This planet’s seen its fair share of events. If I had to remember every little detail, I’d have no reason to write reports now, would I?

Vita: Besides, these things are just nitty-gritty details. Even if I hadn’t told you, the genius detective Fu Hua here would’ve sniffed it out sooner or later.

Fu Hua: Can you guarantee there aren’t more of these nitty-gritty details that you’ve forgotten?

Vita: Urgh… How can I guarantee that?! If I could recall the things I don’t remember, then I wouldn't be unable to remember them in the first place, right? Besides, even if I crossed my heart and hoped to die, you still wouldn’t take my word for it.

Vita: The truth is, if I knew the god’s weakness, I’d have figured out how to deal with them myself, and wouldn’t be stuck in this cramped holo-projection right now with you.

Vita: There’s no chance they’d divulge their weakness to me. It’s not a trust issue, but a “top secret” issue.

Fu Hua: …

It required time for Vita to divulge information. Fu Hua had slowly grasped Vita’s negotiation style.

She couldn’t know for sure how much of what Vita said was true, but she was certain that Vita wouldn’t reveal any more information for now.

Fu Hua: Since we can’t rely on you, we’ll have to gather intel on our own. And the only safe place to do that right now seems to be inside the Ark…

Griseo: Oh, wait. I just thought of a good place to look for what we need.

Griseo: My bedroom.

Fu Hua: …?

Vita: Griseo, is this some kind of bold joke?

Griseo: No, I remember being in my bedroom on the day the Ark crashed.

Griseo: Back then, I was suddenly woken up by a system alert. I didn’t have time to take any emergency measures before something suddenly knocked me out cold.

Griseo: After that, I was in a deep slumber for millennia until Fu Hua woke me up not long ago. Maybe it’s a side effect of forced hibernation, or maybe it’s something Sa did to me, but I can’t remember how I ended up being locked away.

Griseo: But there’s one thing I’m certain of… I was in my bedroom when the anomaly occurred.

Fu Hua: Ah, it’s all coming together now.

Fu Hua: If Sa definitely caused the anomaly, then this is probably the only thing we can trace back to them, right?

Griseo: Yeah, that’s what I meant. Let’s not waste any more time. Come on, let’s go.

Griseo: Alright, this is it.

Righteous Vita: Wow, Griseo, your bedroom is way bigger than I thought.

Veracious Vita: And it’s so neat and tidy. It’s even cleaner than Red’s room.

Griseo: Huh? Really? This room… welle, it must’ve been at least a thousand years since it was last cleaned.

Disciplined Vita: That means Red’s room is even messier than a room left untouched for a thousand years.

Righteous Vita: Come on, you guys! Don’t exaggerate!

Harmonious Vita: But… something about this place feels… wrong.

Encompassing Vita: What do you mean, Purple? Can you sense something?

Harmonious Vita: I can’t say for certain, but something just feels a bit strange…

Fu Hua: …?

Mindful Vita: Yeah, the decor in this room is like nothing found in Phosphorus. If I encountered a room with this style there, I’d definitely think it’s strange.

Mindful Vita: But this is inside the forbidden area, a place that we can’t access. Seeing unfamiliar decor here shouldn’t feel off to us on an instinctual level.

Mindful Vita: In fact, it should be quite the opposite.

Mindful Vita: Purple, do you feel like something’s off because the style here isn’t unfamiliar enough?

Harmonious Vita: Well, when you put it like that… That’s exactly it! Blue, you’re a genius. How did you figure that out?

Mindful Vita: I didn’t exactly figure it out, I just have the same feeling.

Mindful Vita: Cyan must be thinking the same thing as well since he’s been peeking from the sidelines the whole time.

Erudite Vita: Erm… Huh? I mean, yes…

Erudite Vita: We’re all here for the first time, right? I thought it was just my imagination…

Vita: Hey, what are you guys all talking about?

Encompassing Vita: We’re discussing something strange, Miss Vita.

Vita: Hmm, you can’t say a girl’s bedroom is strange. You’ll hurt her feelings otherwise.

Encompassing Vita: Oh, sorry Griseo! How about I make it up to you with a piece of candy?

Griseo: Erm, I don’t really mind…

Vita: Hehe, just accept her kind offer. I kind of miss the taste of this candy as well. I hate that I can’t eat it right now.

Encompassing Vita: Miss Vita…

Vita: It’s alright. Let’s all work together to find that god’s weakness so we can resolve this situation. When that’s done, I’ll be able to return to Phosphorus and reunite with all of you.

Encompassing Vita: Yeah!

Fu Hua: …

Vita: What’s up, Fu Hua? I didn’t say anything weird, did I?

Fu Hua: No, not at all. Let’s keep searching for clues.

Griseo’s Storage Shelf
Griseo’s Easel
Display Screen on the Table

Fu Hua: (This is Griseo’s storage cabinet…)

The spacious cabinet was surprisingly tidy, with colorful paint jars as the only noticeable items. It’s clear that Griseo’s hobbies hadn’t changed, even during the long journey of Project ARK.

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: There’s a gap between the outer and inner paint jars… Were they deliberately taken out? Did Griseo do this?

Fu Hua: (But the colors of these paint jars are…)

Red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. The seven jars were placed on the outer layer, neatly arranged in an intriguing combination.

Fu Hua: …


Fu Hua: (Almost done investigating.)

Fu Hua: (I should see what the others have discovered.)

Righteous Vita: Erm… Yeah…

Veracious Vita: What are you up to, Red?

Veracious Vita: Hey, what are you holding… a book? Wow, Red, I didn’t know you like to read!

Righteous Vita: What’s the big deal? Do you have to act so surprised?

Veracious Vita: Of course, I’m surprised. I don’t remember you ever reading books. Even if we pooled together memories from all those cycles, we could probably count all the occasions when you actually read a book on one hand.

Righteous Vita: Well, this is different! We’re helping Fu Hua and Griseo find clues, aren’t we? So, we must put all our efforts into this. We can’t leave room for carelessness!

Veracious Vita: Is that so?

Righteous Vita: …

Righteous Vita: Also, these books are way more interesting than Green’s thick rule books or Purple’s long poems in celebration.

Veracious Vita: Oh yeah? What kind of books are they?

Righteous Vita turned the books over in her hands and showed them to Veracious Vita.

Veracious Vita: “The Tortoise and the Hare”, “The Wolf and the Lamb”, and “The Boy Who Cried Wolf”... Erm, are these books about animal species?

Righteous Vita: No! Read them and then you’ll understand.

Veracious Vita: Urgh, don’t drag me into this…

Griseo: …

Encompassing Vita: Griseo, are you alright?

Erudite Vita: You look a bit off… Are you feeling faint?

Griseo: I’m fine. Don’t worry about me.

Griseo: The last time I was here was before arriving on this planet. If only I could remember what happened back then…

Encompassing Vita: It’s perfectly normal not to remember something that happened so long ago, Griseo. Cut yourself some slack.

Griseo: No, my and Fu Hua’s bodies are different from regular people’s. We can naturally retain memories for longer. While we may not remember every single detail…

Griseo: There’s no way we can forget certain situations from tens of thousands of years ago. But weirdly, my memory of when I came close to Sa…

Griseo: It’s probably not just about the passage of time. Maybe Sa distorted our perception somehow, or used some kind of mental attack on me.

Griseo: Or perhaps it was simply the blow to my head that resulted in memory loss…

Erudite Vita: That… that sounds brutal.

Encompassing Vita: Griseo, you were attacked in your room before, and now that you’ve finally come back, you’re forcing yourself to remember that experience… It must be really tough on you.

Encompassing Vita: Maybe you should take a break? Just like before, find a cherished spot, sit for a while, feel that familiar potted plant, and embrace your beloved pillow. That might gently coax your memories back without putting too much pressure on yourself.

Griseo: Urgh… I’m fine. I’ve never had a habit of relying one potted plants and pillows…

Griseo: …?

Griseo: Wait… Habit?

Erudite Vita: What’s wrong, Griseo?

Griseo: Well, according to my habits, if I were faced with an unknown and powerful enemy, the first thing I’d turn to would be…

Griseo: (My abilities, perhaps?)

Harmonious Vita: What could it be, though?

Mindful Vita: Purple, Green, check this out! There’s a plant here that hasn’t withered after thousands of years.

Disciplined Vita: I think it’s fake…

Mindful Vita: Well, yeah..e. But the person who made this must’ve been quite romantic. Is it made of some kind of fabric? It’s really interesting.

Harmonious Vita: …

Mindful Vita: How come you aren’t curious, Purple?

Harmonious Vita: Huh? Me?

Disciplined Vita: She’s still thinking about the previous question, Blue. You’re distracting her.

Mindful Vita: Oh… sorry.

Disciplined Vita: But… I’m starting to have a similar feeling. This place feels familiar, but I can’t quite put my finger on why…

Disciplined Vita: What do you think, Blue? We just regained memories from other cycles and lost the last one. Could this be messing with our perception?

Mindful Vita: I’m not sure… The principles of how thought processes and memories are structured are way too complex. Maybe while discussing this, we can draw some inspiration from that plant over there?

Harmonious Vita: …?

Mindful Vita: I can describe the shape, color, and characteristics of this artificial plant quite well, but I can’t trace its manufacturing details, let alone who made it.

Mindful Vita: If memories have similar properties…

Disciplined Vita: What are you talking about, Blue?

Mindful Vita: I’m just speculating. It’s not really helping with the current situation though.

Mindful Vita: …Nothing.

A few moments later…

Vita: Everyone has thoroughly finished investigating, right? Good job, everyone.

Veracious Vita: Well, everyone apart from Miss Vita has finished searching through everything.

Vita: Haha, Yellow, you haven’t changed a bit. You never show any mercy, not even to me.

Vita: I can’t help it. If this candy could grow hands and feet, I definitely wouldn’t just stand here while you’re all busy.

Encompassing Vita: Urgh… That sounds creepy…

Griseo: Time is of the essence. Let’s coordinate our findings now.

Griseo: Let me start first. Thanks to Orange, I finally remembered something.

Fu Hua: Huh?

Griseo: People tend to have relatively fixed subconscious reactions when accidents happen. Even though my memory is blurry, I might be able to reconstruct what happened at that time by imagining what I’d do according to my habits.

Griseo: During my extended interstellar journey, I recorded numerous experiences and insights in the form of colors, as my unique ability allows me to perceive the true colors of things.

Griseo: Likewise, when faced with unexpected danger, my natural instinct was to identify the colors of that danger.

Griseo: So, when I was attacked by Sa, I probably instinctively perceived the colors of the force attacking me and tried to record it.

Fu Hua: So, could that be what the painting board I found represents?

Griseo: Exactly. Because it was an emergency, I didn’t even have time to lay out a new canvas. I just managed to finish recording the colors when I was struck by some external force.

Mindful Vita: So, this messy cluster of colors is Sa’s colors?

Harmonious Vita: Hmm… It looks really chaotic…

Griseo: Yes, because this is actually an incomplete color record.

Griseo: If I could clearly depict Sa’s colors, it would mean I completely understood their nature, and things wouldn’t be like they are today.

Griseo: This record is just my feelings of the colors I perceived in that moment of peril, and a rough sketch of the first impression I had when Sa attacked me.

Griseo: I couldn’t fathom what lay beneath that first impression. And it’s the same situation right now.

Mindful Vita: So… does that mean the lead ends here?

Griseo: No, this color record…

Griseo: The faint shadow that emerged just now in the sky is a part of Sa’s body… Moriarty mentioned this as well.

Griseo: There’s a chance we can gather information about Sa by observing those body parts. So, I focused on Moriarty and observed the moment he touched the light pillar.

Fu Hua: Did you notice anything?

Griseo: Unfortunately, Moriarty’s holo-projection was too fragile, and the connection with Sa was very brief. I couldn’t analyse much of it, but even so…

Griseo: The color from back then was very similar to this color record here.

Vita: …Oh?

Griseo: However… these two colors, although very similar, also have some subtle differences.

Griseo: But I can’t pinpoint exactly what those differences are.

Vita: Well, it’s been a long time, so the Creator may have slightly altered her appearance.

Griseo: …

Disciplined Vita: Let’s talk about our findings. It’s the deja vu that we’ve all been feeling.

Disciplined Vita: According to Phosphorus’ rules, we didn’t have any chance to enter the Ark before. But somehow, everyone finds it familiar here.

Harmonious Vita: Yeah, it’s like we’ve seen it somewhere before…

Mindful Vita: …

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: Maybe I know why. Your familiarity with this room is most likely because…

Fu Hua: At the beginning of every cycle, you were born here.

Righteous Vita: …?!

Disciplined Vita: We… we were born in the forbidden area?

Mindful Vita: That’s right. The Ark is the only place not affected by the floods, and naturally, it’s the only sanctuary where we can be reset.

Mindful Vita: But, can you provide more specific evidence to support your theory, Fu Hua?

Fu Hua: (Blue…)

Fu Hua: Of course. It’s related to your sister, this older Vita.

Vita: Oh, me again?

Fu Hua: Yep, because you’re clearly still not willing to share some information.

Fu Hua: Check this out.

Fu Hua led everyone to the table and showed them the unusual screen.

Griseo: Something’s not right about it.

Griseo: Its mode has been altered since I piloted the Ark.

Fu Hua: Yeah, someone modified the system here after you fell into a deep sleep to give it new functions.

Fu Hua: And the one behind all this…

Following Fu Hua’s finger, everyone looked at a small peacock-green feather-shaped logo under the screen.

Fu Hua: This is your symbol, isn’t it, Vita?

Vita: Uh-oh… Busted…

Fu Hua: Or rather, it’s a mark you intentionally left behind. Also, this room is obviously being cleaned regularly, which is why it’s so tidy even after thousands of years.

Vita: Well, no one wants their workplace to be dusty, right?

Fu Hua: You’ve also seen Griseo’s storybooks here. You shouldn’t have any knowledge of our civilisation’s stories, yet you managed to alter them and recount a twisted version.

Vita: Well, I had quite a bit of time to kill while waiting for the reset.

Fu Hua: And this explains why you knew Griseo so well from the beginning.

Vita: If you’re using someone’s bedroom, then you should at least get familiar with the owner. It’s a bit rude otherwise, isn’t it?

Fu Hua: And just like before, you didn’t offer a direct clue. But at the same time, you didn’t make a concerted effort to conceal anything either. It almost feels like you wanted us to stumble upon it.

Fu Hua: So, why didn’t you tell us right from the beginning?

Vita: Hehe, I was just playing a little game with you, Fu Hua, the Great Detective. What’s so wrong with that?

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: Is she truly evil, or is there something preventing her from voicing the truth? It appears we can’t uncover the answer right now.

Vita: Well, although the little game’s purpose is still a mystery, I can tell you that each time the old cycle ends and the new one begins, the Vitas are reawakened here.

Vita: And every time, poor little me has to rescue everyone from the ruins of the great flood, clean them up, and reset their memories.

Vita: It’s a really tough job. If it wasn’t for me, everyone would be floundering in the water like drowning dogs.

Mindful Vita: …

Encompassing Vita: Miss Vita…

Disciplined Vita: So, it was you who implanted our rules and led us back to Phosphorus?

Vita: Yep. And you were especially obedient, Green. You were always one of the Vitas who understood my instructions the most quickly.

Vita: Oh yeah, Orange was great too. There was one time when you helped me hold back Red, who was lagging behind as always.

Righteous Vita: Did the Creator you all mentioned order you to do this?

Vita: Well, we’re their experiments after all.

Vita shrugged and chuckled bitterly, then subtly glanced at Fu Hua.

Vita: So, the Ark is truly the birthplace of the Vitas.

Vita: However, this is unlikely to be related to the Creator’s weakness. In the end, they would never trouble themselves with these trivial affairs. So, it’s always fallen on my poor little head. Even if you were to delve deeper into the research, you would only trace it back to me.

Vita: Also, Vitas, just like babies, never keep the memories each time they are born through me. Even if I were to recount it, it wouldn’t trigger any recollection.

Disciplined Vita: You’re wrong.

Vita: Oh yeah?

Disciplined Vita: Although we still can’t remember any of that experience even after hearing it from you…

Disciplined Vita: We do have a sense of deja vu, so does that mean that deep down in our subconscious, we can still perceive something?

Harmonious Vita: Oh! That’s true!

Righteous Vita: Should we search the Ark again with this sense of deja vu? We might discover something we didn’t notice before!

Griseo: But…

Fu Hua: That’s a good idea.

Griseo: …?

Fu Hua: Then I’m counting on everyone. I’ll place my trust in you, Vitas.

Fu Hua: But remember not to wander too far. And if you encounter any enemies, don’t act recklessly. Report back to us as soon as possible.

Righteous Vita: You have my word! We’ll definitely complete this task!

Led by Red, the Vitas left the bedroom and went to explore other areas of the Ark.

Meanwhile…

Griseo: …

Fu Hua: Okay, Vita, care to share a few things now?

Vita: You make me sound like a stubborn, naughty girl.

Fu Hua: …

Vita: Alright, alright. I’ll stop teasing you. You helped me divert the Vitas, so I should help you resolve your doubts. Consider it a mutual courtesy.

Vita: Let me guess… Your question is about color, right?

Fu Hua: Go ahead, Griseo.

Griseo: Well, I just compared to the colors on the painting board with the colors one the light pillar when it devoured Moriarty.

Griseo: Both of these colors are very chaotic and profound. But, relatively speaking, Sa has become purer now.

Griseo: Something essential has been drawn out of the Creator over these millennia.

Fu Hua: The extracted colors… Were there exactly seven of them, by any chance?

Griseo: Well, there are more than just seven… What are you getting at, Fu Hua?

Fu Hua: Here, can you see it?

Fu Hua gestured for Griseo to check the paints taken off the rack.

Fu Hua: Red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. This isn’t your usual method of painting, right?

Griseo: Yeah, I don’t normally do that. Putting these seven colors in this order doesn’t make much sense.

Fu Hua: Especially considering there are only three primary colors. Arranging these seven hues together isn’t a practice typical of artists, but more akin to…

Vita: Scientists. To be more precise, it’s a habit of scientists living in space, whose eyes happen to have three types of cone cells. For us, sunlight is composed of seven colors.

Griseo: …?

Fu Hua: …

Vita: You notice everything as always, Fu Hua. Yes, the Creator and I were inspired bey it here to create seven Vitas.

Vita: But, how did you work it out? Those paints don’t seem like evidence.

Fu Hua: I couldn’t help but think that there must be a starting point for everything. You mentioned your role in retrieving the Vitas after each great flood, but what about the very first time? The Vitas first appeared before any major flood, didn’t they?

Fu Hua: You deliberately avoided discussing that, so there must be something behind it.

Vita: Correct… Now, as you look at that light pillar, it’s quite challenging to imagine what the Creator might’ve been in the past. Truth be told, the Creator had moments when they were just like us… Although, even for me, that’s already a bygone era, stretching back a very, very long time.

Vita: In a nutshell, the Creator engaged in a continuous journey of self-improvement over a long duration, amassing vast amounts of energy and shedding superfluous structures while refining their efficiency.

Vita: As for the seven Vitas, they emerged as a byproduct of the Creator’s body as they optimised themselves. Although, describing it purely as an objective process might not be entirely accurate. It’s possible they had another intention at that time. Nevertheless, since the Creator hasn’t disclosed it to me, I can’t say for sure.

Fu Hua: A byproduct?

Vita: Yes, and you, Griseo, are the one who inspired them.

Griseo: …?

Vita: Once the Creator captured the Ark and you, they became aware of your color analysis ability. Your capacity to intuitively decipher the essence of things on a case-by-case basis intrigued them.

Vita: Thus, they began to contemplate whether they could similarly dissect abstract concepts, such as emotions and morality, in the same manner they had separated the mixed colors.

Vita: While the notion may have crossed their mind before, you provided the specific inspiration they needed from that paint rack. Subsequently, the Creator formally relinquished their redundant virtues, and left the rest to me.

Griseo: …?

Vita: The Creator mechanically fragmented their virtues and granted these mixed colors various authorisations. They then tasked me with shaping them into puppet rulers for governing the city, which is somewhat akin to the Paradise Wardens.

Vita: Naturally, aesthetics remained a crucial aspect of the process. Thus, I classified these authorisations into Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, and Purple, giving them the endearing form that you see today.

Griseo: …

Fu Hua: You don’t want the Vitas to know about this. Is it because you’re worried that…?

Vita: Well, I’m not really worried about anything. It’s more like a sense of shyness.

Vita: It’s somewhat similar to explaining in intricate detail how children come into existence. And that’s even in front of Griseo.

Vita: The inspiration came from Griseo, while the art of shaping came from me. So, from that perspective, the Vitas could be considered our creations.

Griseo: …?

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: Now that we’ve unraveled the origins of the Vitas, even though Vita insists it isn’t related to Sa’s weakness…

Fu Hua: (I can’t help but feel that we may have overlooked something.)

Moriarty: See that? That looming entity faintly visible beyond the clouds? That is merely one of its limbs. Quite massive, isn’t it?

Moriarty: I’ve tried many ways to approach it, but unfortunately, it seems to be under the protection of something whose nature surpasses that of this planet.

Moriarty: I even tried to fly up high, but due to what I can only assume is insufficient, shall we say, “authorisation”, I was unable to get even a millimeter closer.

Fu Hua: …!

Suddenly, the words of that artist rushed back to Fu Hua.

Fu Hua: (If the Vitas are derived from Sa, then their authorisation…)

Fu Hua: Yes, their authorisation.

Vita: …Oh?

Fu Hua: As the authorisation of representatives overlaps somewhat with those of the Creator, then…

???: Perhaps we can utilise our authorisation to counter the Creator. Is that right?

…?

At some point, the Vitas returned to the entrance of the bedroom.

Mindful Vita: This time, we might have truly uncovered the Creator’s weakness.

--

Gameplay 42-9 - Perfect Cooperation

Fu Hua: Blue… You’re all back?

Vita: How long have you been eavesdropping?

Veracious Vita: Just now. We only heard Fu Hua talking about authorisation.

Vita: Is that so?

Vita: That’s fantastic, Griseo. The children haven’t figured it out yet.

Griseo: Is there anything that should remain undiscovered?

Fu Hua disregarded Vita’s untimely humor and looked at the Little Vitas.

Fu Hua: You mentioned uncovering the Creator’s weakness. What’s the whole story exactly?

Harmonious Vita: Well, to be precise, we didn’t uncover it, we just put our heads together and worked it out.

Encompassing Vita: While we were revisiting the Ark, that sense of deja vu intensified. Miss Vita… she was correct.

Erudite Vita: Our memories were all over the place before, and the history we’ve patched together lacked a clear sequence. Sudden beginnings, recurring lifetimes, and abrupt apocalypses had all left scattered fragments of memories strewn across our minds.

Mindful Vita: Yet, this starting point helped bridge the gaps between those memories, giving us a framework to grasp everything that’s happened. And because of that…

Mindful Vita: While we were exploring, we started to reconstruct the history of this planet, ponder our roles in different civilisations, and strive to learn from our past missteps.

Veracious Vita: Even though it was always us who brought the Creator’s severe punishment to Phosphorus each time…

Righteous Vita: It wasn’t actually our fault! We wanted to protect Phosphorus more than anyone else!

Disciplined Vita: The ones responsible for sabotaging this mission were not us, but the Creator. They controlled Miss Vita, implanted false rules, and handed us the key to destruction.

Disciplined Vita: Perhaps they aren’t doing it on purpose… But to us, even if they did create this world, they’ve become the enemies of us because of this.

Mindful Vita: And this got us thinking… Since we’ve got the Creator’s keys, that means we can summon them and face their judgment, just like in that recent Honkai event.

Mindful Vita: And that, of course, means the keys in our hands are somehow directly linked to the Creator.

Righteous Vita: After Blue came up with this, I immediately rushed back with everyone, and then I overheard Fu Hua discussing authorisation!

Disciplined Vita: Can you explain that further, Fu Hua?

Fu Hua: …

Griseo: …

Fu Hua: Sure.

Vita: …

Fu Hua left out the story of the Vitas’ birth and instead shared the conclusion they had all suspected.

Fu Hua: In other words, the authorisation granted to you by Sa was separated from their own. The authorisation you hold shares the same roots as Sa’s, albeit with more constraints.

Fu Hua: And according to Vita, Sa has been continuously eliminating their redundant parts. As a colossal entity, they must rely on a multitude of logic mechanisms to make detailed choices.

Mindful Vita: So, we can not only summon the Creator’s judgment, but theoretically, we can also use the logical flaws and imperfections inherent in these decision-making mechanisms to counter the Creator.

Righteous Vita: So does that mean we’ve discovered the Creator’s weakness? We just need to use our authorisation.

Vita: Hold your horses, Little Red. Although this plan is theoretically viable…

Vita: Just creating a gateway close to the Creator’s true form using only your authorisation won’t suffice. You lack the required energy and authority to open such a passage.

Mindful Vita: So, why not get someone with such capability to do it?

Vita: …

Fu Hua: …!

Righteous Vita: Fu Hua, and Griseo, we’ve decided to transfer all our authorisation to you. You’re capable combatants. That way, you can neutralise the Creator’s threat to Phosphorus!

Disciplined Vita: After much deliberation, we came to this consensus. In accordance with the Vita Gathering rules, we have unanimously decided.

Fu Hua: The representatives’ authorisation…

Griseo: But, for you…

Veracious Vita: For us, the authorisation is undoubtedly essential. And if…

Mindful Vita: Currently, the city’s code won’t allow authorisation to be transferred. So there’s potential for severe consequences if we fail.

Mindful Vita: Still, even Green, that stickler for rules, has given her nod of approval. So that means we’re good to go, right?

Harmonious Vita: We’re all of the opinion that safeguarding Phosphorus takes precedence over authorisation.

Griseo: …

Harmonious Vita: My intuition tells me that entrusting the authorisation to you is the right call, since you’re both so trustworthy and reliable.

Encompassing Vita: Absolutely. Even when we were in the dark, unable to tell friends from foes due to losing our memories, both of you extended your hands to help us without hesitation.

Erudite Vita: While we may have lost the memories of our moments spent with Fu Hua, we still feel like it was a joyful and unforgettable time.

Righteous Vita: So, we unanimously agree that Fu Hua and Griseo will take control of the representatives’ authorisation. Consider it the most prestigious honor in all of Phosphorus!

Veracious Vita: But, in reality, we have no choice but to have you two fight for us.

Disciplined Vita: We are useless in combat and can only contribute a little.

Fu Hua: You’ve already done the best you can. We cannot ask for more.

Griseo: When a crisis unfolds, not everyone is armed and ready to fight. You might only have a wrench, a test tube, or a pen at your disposal…

Griseo: But as long as you can recognise the value of those items and give it your all when the opportunity arises, then you have a shot at defeating enemies who seem much more powerful than you.

Righteous Vita: Oh, that makes sense!

Vita: …

Fu Hua: (Vita…)

Vita: Ahh, you’re just as clever as I thought, my little siblings. That’s a very clever way of looking at it.

Vita: Agree that this plan may work. Go ahead and do your best!

Fu Hua: (She…)

[CHOICE] This plan…


…

[CHOICE] Is there anything I haven’t noticed?


…

[CHOICE] Will this alter her attitude?


After a brief moment of hesitation, Fu Hua shook her head to clear any lingering doubts.

Fu Hua: (She won’t tell the truth if we ask her, and, as she mentioned before, if the plan has any flaws, we’re all in this together.)

Fu Hua: Well then, let’s proceed with this plan.

Fu Hua: To be more specific, assuming we’re getting close to Sa’s true form, we need someone to lay down the groundwork for the passage while another takes charge of advancing.

Fu Hua: Griseo, with your master of authorisation composed of spiritual power, you should be better at creating the concrete path. As a holo-projection, I’m easier to transport with fewer constraints when dealing with enemies.

Fu Hua: As our first attempt, I’ll take the role of forging ahead, while you handle receiving the Vitas’ transferred authorisation and laying the path. Does that sound good to you?

Griseo: Yeah, no problem.

Fu Hua: And as for you…

Vita: Huh? Why are you all looking at me? Sorry, but there’s no way I can lay the path or help battle our way through. I’m useless in those matters.

Vita: After all, I’m just a “guest” holo-projection, and I can’t create a virtual path or help you fight radio wave monsters, can I?

Fu Hua: True, you are just a holo-projection in this place. But, while you’ve been prohibited from approaching Phosphorus, we will most likely confront your Creator beyond Phosphorus next. When that time comes, will you personally assist us in battle?

Vita: Well, it’s not every day that the Great Detective extends such a warm invitation!

Vita: But no… That’s a no-go.

Vita: I lost the authority to approach the Creator after our connection was cut some time ago. Otherwise, the Vitas wouldn’t have to help you now.

Vita: Also, as I mentioned earlier, my primary form took a severe beating, so I’m incredibly frail. Extremely so, in fact. If you sent me into battle, the Creator could snape their fingers and make me vanish completely.

Vita: So… it’s not that I’m unwilling to lend a hand, but that I wouldn’t be very helpful if I did. But don’t worry, since my adorable Vitas are giving it their all, how can I just stand by and watch?

Vita: I can still help you in one way… by lifting the lock on the representatives’ authorisation.

Fu Hua: Lifting the lock?

Vita: Yep, you can bet the Creator has locked those crucial authorisations down tight. I mean, even an inexperienced coder wouldn’t overlook that.

Vita: So, transferring those authorisations directly is a no-go.

Disciplined Vita: That’s right. We hashed this out earlier and the verdict was… Miss Vita must have a card up her sleeve.

Vita: Hehe, looks like we’re all on the same wavelength here.

Vita: Here’s the deal: I need to unlock your authorisation, but, I’m afraid I can’t do it alone.

Vita: Griseo, it looks like it’s time for another intimate team-up.

Griseo: …?

Vita: Next up, I’ll be your guide into the shared mental realm of the Vitas. Put simply, this is a space where Sa’s security measures become real.

Vita: Your job is to deal with the security systems inside. You can use a bit of brute force.

Griseo: I understand your plan, but… why me?

Vita: I’ve taken my mental escapades to the limit, and I’m not that eager to jump back in and deal with the Creator’s guards. And as for Fu Hua, while she might pack a punch in combat, she’s still a semi-holo-projection with unpredictable traits…

Vita: Looking at what’s best for me and the current reality, this mission is all yours, Griseo.

Griseo: Alright, I see.

Griseo: Then… I’ll leave you in charge on the outside, Fu Hua.

Fu Hua: Okay, you’re up for the mental realm fight, no doubt. Make sure you stay sharp. If things go off the rails, leave it to me.

Griseo: Alright, no problem!

Griseo: Now, how are you going to walk me through this?

Vita: It’s pretty simple. Just follow me.

Griseo: This place is…!

Griseo: Vita, are you here? What’s happening?

Griseo: …Vita?

Griseo: …!

Griseo: Don’t… don’t tell me this is some sort of trap…

Griseo: But those monsters weren’t in the dreams I had before…

Griseo: …What’s going on?

Griseo: Could it be…

It wasn’t until Griseo dealt with those sudden Paradise Warden attackers that Vita’s voice appeared, all cool and collected.

Vita: Wow, Griseo’s got some serious skills, taking out those guys so quickly. Looks like I was right after all.

Griseo: Vita… What’s really going on here?

Vita: It’s just as we discussed. I’m guiding you into the Vitas’ mental realm, and your job is to handle the security systems here.

Vita: Maybe you were thrown off to begin with because this mental realm looks too much like your own dreams.

Griseo: This is the Vitas’ mental realm, not my art studio. It’s not that hard to know this fact.

Griseo: …

Griseo: Nevermind. Tell me where the next batch of Paradise Wardens are. I don’t want to drag things out too long and weigh the Little Vitas down mentally.

Vita: (Oh, so that’s what’s bugging you…?)

Vita: Alright, alright! I’ll be your guide!

Griseo: These Paradise Wardens are definitely different from the ones outside. Not just in terms of their physical and mental forms, they - textbox cut-off

???: For the sake of… Phosphorus…

???: Unraveling the world’s truth… is a must…

Griseo: Are those… the Vitas’ voices?

???: I won’t let it… all end like this…

???: …

Griseo: …

Vita: We’re making progress! Keep it up, Griseo!

???: We can’t just let it end like this… Our city…

???: We could’ve created so many more memories…

???: Everyone… the Vitas’ home…

Griseo: (This is…)

Vita: This is the final barrier, Griseo. Destroy it and we’ll unlock the representatives’ authorisation!

Griseo: …?

Griseo: (It’s really different from before… If this is the “safeguard” that Sa left behind…)

Griseo: Then those earlier… Could they be…

Griseo: …

Griseo: (They knew it… from the start?)

Griseo: …

Griseo: I… I can’t let everyone down!

???: …

Griseo: It’s over.

Vita: Awesome! You did an amazing job, Griseo.

Vita: The lock on the representatives’ authorisation has been entirely lifted, and they’re now “free”. Hmm, perhaps I’m explaining too much? You’re able to “see through the surface”, after all.

Griseo: …

Vita: Anyway, let’s wrap things up here and head back. The others are waiting for us.

Griseo: …

She felt as though her consciousness was rising up from the sea. She could hear countless familiar and strange voices.

Fear and trepidation. Pain, desire, and an unwillingness to move on. There were quiet sobs and sighs of despair.

Before she could understand, they disappeared in the sea all at once, like a television being shut off.

Then, her consciousness finally emerged.

Griseo: …

Reopening her eyes, Griseo found herself seated on the bed in her bedroom. The seven Vitas encircled her, with Vita’s holo-projection at their side.

Griseo: What…?

Harmonious Vita: Ah, Griseo’s awake!

Disciplined Vita: Great work, Griseo. Did it all go smoothly?

Griseo: Absolutely. You should now have full control over the representatives’ authorisation. You can sense it, right?

Griseo gazed at the Vitas. They were all wearing a similar look… a blend of childlike innocence, the gravitas befitting representatives, and the unwavering resolve expected of Project Deliverance enforcers.

Disciplined Vita: Yes, we can feel it.

Righteous Vita: It’s like the heavy burden that’s been weighing on our chests just vanished in an instant!

Veracious Keys: It’s probably because the keys hanging on our chests have genuinely become lighter. Even though I don’t quite understand the mechanics behind it…

Griseo: …

Seeing Veracious Vita, Griseo felt a change within herself.

Griseo: So, everyone, are we ready to transfer the authorisation now?

Mindful Vita: As a safety measure, we should do a bit of fine-tuning. We need to synchronise the status of the authorisation among the seven of us first.

Erudite Vita: None of us have experience with this kind of transfer. So just in case something goes south, we should be extra careful.

Griseo: This won’t harm you, right?

Righteous Vita: Of course not.

Griseo: Yellow, what’s your take on this?

Veracious Vita: Don’t fret, Griseo. This operation is perfectly safe.

Veracious Vita: Transferring authorisation won’t pose any threat to us. Even if it doesn’t go as planned, there won’t be any life-threatening risks.

Griseo: …

Griseo: Alright, I got it.

Encompassing Vita: So, when we’re all set, we’ll come to you!

Griseo: We’ll leave it to you then.

Vita: …

Griseo: By the way, where did Fu Hua disappear to?

Righteous Vita: She just said, “Since you guys still need some fine-tuning, I’ll go fine-tune myself”, and then went off to the Ark’s bridge all on her own.

Griseo: Fine-tune herself? Fu Hua?

Erudite Vita: I overheard her talking about trying to evoke some artificial elements while in holo-projection mode.

Griseo: (...?)

Fu Hua: …

Griseo: Griseo should be ready soon. And then, it’ll all be up to me…

Fu Hua: (My opponent is a colossal evil lurking in the Sea of Quanta, and all I have is a mere holo-projection.)

Fu Hua: (But here’s the silver lining.)

Fu Hua: (Up until now, this holo-projection seems to have been cooperating with me, constantly revealing my untapped potential.)

Fu Hua: So, this time…

Fu Hua: …Let’s give it our all from the get-go.

Fu Hua has never shied away from a life-and-death battle.

Throughout her long and eventful life, “fighting for one’s life” has been but an occasional challenge she faced.

If anything, no one could know that someone like her would hesitate to confront a formidable foe before stepping onto the battlefield. It almost sounds unbelievable.

However, due to her extensive experience on the battlefield, Fu Hua also understands that courage doesn’t equate to recklessness.

She’s long past the days of blindly turning herself into a monster, and charging into battle without a second thought.

She’s moved beyond that era, that period, and that chapter of her life. Her current fight isn’t about some distant future. It’s about protecting the tangible present that belongs to everyone.

So, she must, and she firmly believes she can, control and harness that formidable power that’s dreaded by all. Even though she’s just a holo-projection.

For the sake of her friends and herself.

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: Garuda…

Fu Hua: Come forth.

[CG plays wherein Fu Hua attempts to enter Active Honkai Reaction state, but quickly reverts back and fades away.]

Under the gaze of the Creator, it usually took a mere second for all the previous efforts to end up fruitless.

“For whosoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever has not, from him shall be taken away even what he has.”

Said the Creator.

Act 2 - Truth and Kindness
Gameplay 42-10 - The Heel of God

???: “Be careful. The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry.”

???: “A plan is most precarious when it’s about to end.”

???: Just like now.

Moriarty: Could it be… the hell in this system?

Moriarty: Haha, what a letdown.

Moriarty: Hmm, it seems I can still pull off an act. If this counts as one, that is.

Moriarty: The data loss percentage has surpassed 99%, but… I won the bet. Hahaha!

Moriarty: Even though I have less than 1% of data remaining, my self-awareness is still unimpaired, and has reached the end of the data currents, the center of planets, and the heart of God.

Moriarty: Isn’t it rather uncouth to welcome the challenger who dared to walk into the culprit’s lair alone, “Sa”?

…

Moriarty: Hmm… Silence is still an answer. It seems it’s up to me to reveal your hidden secret.

On the scorched earth, faint prayers were echoing.

In the depths of the sea, mysterious ballads were being sang.

In the great void of space, cold murmurs were heard.

Moriarty: All of these… are memories…

Moriarty: Observe everything She once laid eyes on through the omniscient and almighty eyes of “God”... Wow, that sounds fun!

Moriarty: It’s a real shame there’s no one to share this joy with, but…

Moriarty: The deepest secrets always hide within memories, and sometimes even the owner of those memories can’t find them. Come on now. Let me see how the grand play of God’s life unfolds.

The sight was filled with broken pieces that resembled stained glass shards, each reflecting a bizarre view.

Moriarty: Ugh!

Flames consuming everything on the land, ancient ruins shattered to pieces, twinkling light in the depth…

Moriarty: Uhh…

On the planet, there seemed to be a huge chess board, upon which something was walking, something was sneering, and something was weeping.

Moriarty: …

Moriarty: Hahaha, so that’s what it is!

Moriarty: So, that’s your last resort, Sa? When you discovered that someone was lurking and guiding you secretly, you didn’t plan to confront them from the start. Instead, you decided to wield your power and downright obliterate everything on the ground.

Moriarty: But if you refuse to show yourself, then wasn’t our great detective doing everything for nothing?

Moriarty: Isn’t that… a little boring?

Moriarty: This stage took a lot of effort to prepare, but the play can’t begin without all the actors present.

Moriarty: But fortunately, your logic now is way too formulaic. Figuring out the pattern is like child’s play to me.

Moriarty: So long as I stir up some mischief here, you’ll transfer your original entity to a safer place out of consideration for the balance of resources.

Moriarty: And during that process, you’ll eventually materialise and inevitably expose a part of your true form, which… Hehehe.

Moriarty: Urgh… I’m reluctant to admit it, but my actions will eventually help the detective.

Moriarty: …

Moriarty: Heh, that’s not a big deal though. It’s my own decision to direct this play of revenge.

Moriarty: An opera box exclusive to Moriarty.

Moriarty: Oh, lofty deity, I won’t allow you to have your own way and act like a coward.

Moriarty: The day you fall from your pedestal is drawing near.

Gameplay 42-11 - The Cost of Sin

“You should know that God's footsteps are hidden in everything in the world.”

“Renounce desires, do not covet others’ possessions, and you shall experience true joy.”

Otherwise…

…

For a precious moment, the light of consciousness illuminated a corner of the boundless darkness.

Consciousness once again awakened from the expanding cracks.

???: …

This time, the meditator took longer to find the reason why they reawakened from the ever-expanding tangle.

As well as the ensuing hope that had died out for an eternity.

Sa: …

Sa: This is what Phosphorus looks like now?

Sa: …Huh?

Sa: …Heh.

She wasn’t surprised by the changes she’d undergone.

Or rather, it was fortunate that she could still project herself and personally observe the results of the seeding in Phosphorus with her own eyes.

As for whether she could continue to smell the fragrance of flowers, feel the warmth of light, and touch every bit of reality with a human body… In the gains and losses brought by multiple expansions, such mundane considerations had no place in her mind and were even unnecessary.

After all, only expansion could exist for eternity within the body of Sa.

Sa: …

Gains and losses… She always experienced such things.

If fate truly operated under such laws, then losing her human form might be the undeniable proof that she’d already touched the sky.

Sa: Either way, the time for examination has arrived.

Sa: Huh?

Phosphorus Resident: Watch out!

Phosphorus Resident: I’m so sorry! Are you okay? Did I hurt you?

Sa: Not really.

Phosphorus Resident: Oh, that’s good.

Phosphorus Resident: Hmm… The way you dress is so foreign. Could it be…

Phosphorus Resident: Are you filming? Roleplaying? Are you an alien?

Sa: Alien… That’s an unexpectedly accurate word.

Phosphorus Resident: Huh? Is it true?

Phosphorus Resident: Hmm… What to do, then? Aliens exist after all… But how come…?

Phosphorus Resident: No… Regardless of what you intend to do in Phosphorus, you should have a guide who’s familiar with this place to lead the way!

Phosphorus Resident: Like the tavern waitress Yuna, the patrolman Uncle Reed… and the “all-knowing” Nana. Hehe, that’s me!

Nana: To be honest though, among everyone who understands Phosphorus well, not a single person would dare to say they know more about it than I do.

Nana: So, what do you say?

Sa: …

Perhaps her words were quite persuasive, as she found herself involuntarily contemplating the offer. However, just as she was about to nod in agreement, she suddenly remembered who she was…

Thanks to the power of the sea, her roots could intertwine here and extend into the sea of stars.

Although she hadn’t fully grasped every strand of power flowing through her roots yet, she had indeed accomplished the miracle of transforming the ecosystems and nurturing life.

And this layer of mystery destined these creations to never truly recognise their creator. Even if they made such contact, their memory of their creator would soon be wiped.

For a human, such a being is often referred to as a “deity”. But if that were the case, then why would She need the help of a human?

Sa: Thank you, but I’ll pass.

Nana: Erm, okay then. Have fun! And… and I wish you a pleasant day!

Sa: You too…

Sa: …

Sa: …

With an almost concrete idea in her mind, she began to attempt something she’d never done before…

Vendor: Hey, check out my fresh sunny eggplants! Do you want a sack?

Vendor: There’s no discount for single ones, but you can get three sweet jademelons for free if you buy a sack full!

Narrowing his eyes, the old man looked at the customer before him up and down.

Vendor: Since you’re not a familiar face, I feel compelled to give you some advice: The young people in Phosphorus these days think they’re incredibly clever, but all they do is play various tricks.

Vendor: They especially like to sprinkle water on wilted vegetables to create the illusion that they’ve been freshly picked from the fields. Or sometimes, they downright tamper with the smart scales, tricking old folks like me who struggle with high-tech gadgets!

Vendor: You see, everyone can figure out the quality and weight of vegetables by looking at and weighing them, so why keep up the facade?

[CHOICE] Stay silent

The old man’s eyes shimmered with sincerity.

Nevertheless, she still detected something impure within them.

[CHOICE] Gaze inward

The advice was indeed well-intentioned, as he didn’t consider his upcoming actions to be wrong.

The vegetables he sold were indeed fresh. At least the ones stacked on top were. However, there were many rotting vegetables underneath. Guided by his principle of “never wasting food”, he still chose to put the rotten vegetables on the shelves.

He trusted his aging but sharp eyes and skilled hands.

Of course, if anyone noticed something amiss later and came looking for him, he’d make sure that his hands and eyes aged appropriately.

Sa: …

Vendor: Hey, don’t leave so quickly! I’ll give you another sweet jademelon for free!


Vendor: You bad-mouthing me to others again, old geezer?

Vendor: You can’t make any money so you blame my selling techniques? Has your brain finally gone to mush?

The young merchant cursed angrily. Even when he saw a new customer, his expression didn’t soften in the slightest.

Vendor: Tsk… What kind of expression is that?

Vendor: Do you think the old geezer is right? You think I’m using this water to trick people?

[CHOICE] - Gaze inward

“If you’re not buying, then get lost! Don’t interfere with my business, or else…”

Dark, swamp-like fantasies instantly filled his heart, and he skillfully manipulated them, leaving the old man and himself struggling for breath within.

Sa: …Heh.

Sa: In many ways, you are consistent. Equally detestable and pitiable.

Vendor: Are you insane?

Sa: …


A man who was focused on arranging his empty backpack could occasionally be heard mumbling to himself.

Mumbling Man: If I carry too much bottled water, it’ll be too heavy, but if I bring too little, I’ll get thirsty…

Mumbling Man: Hmm, I guess I’ll spend a bit more to buy two more boxes of water purification tablets. Leia will definitely get angry when I return home, but there’s no other way.

Mumbling Man: Quit staring! I’m not playing around, you know!

[CHOICE] 1. - Stay silent
[CHOICE] 2. - Gaze inward

Sa: …


Woman: Hey, did you hear? Lord Penney’s house was completely ransacked by a thief!

Woman: Also, the thief drew eerie symbols all over the house and placed or stuck something red at their center. And before leaving, he even rang the doorbell.

Woman: That has got to be the boldest and most heinous incident to occur in the past five years!

[CHOICE] 1. - Stay silent
[CHOICE] 2. - Gaze inward


Sa: …

Man: Hahaha! Five years? It’s not even the worst thing to happen this year!

Man: Like you said, it’s just an ordinary theft at most… right?

Woman: Erm… I suppose.

Woman: Besides, although the criminals are in the wrong, aren’t the victims partially to blame?

Woman: They know how things are in Phosphorus. Some of them might even be the main reason behind the current situation, yet they still refuse to take precautions. Doesn’t this make it their fault?

Man: Take Penney for example. I bet this is retaliation against him. Phosphorus hasn’t improved under the rule of this new governor, rather, it’s getting worse by the day.

Man: There’s a small case every three days, and a big case every five. Living in constant fear has made everyone lose hope.

[CHOICE] - Gaze inward

“Phosphorus might as well be destroyed, along with everyone.”

“Whether it’s a giant rock falling from the sky or a sinkhole doesn’t matter, so long as I’m with my mother.”

Sa: …

Even if she had stopped gazing into the man’s heart, she knew that this thought had long been lurking in his mind, and now it had simply come forth.

That was all.


Cat: Meow!

Sa: It seems to be afraid of humans.

The black cat suddenly stopped in its tracks… because another human appeared not far ahead.

Black Cat: …!

Sa: Heh.

Perhaps it was a coincidence, but the black cat in front of her bore a striking resemblance to her old “buddy” Marah, both in terms of appearance and character.

Because of that, she suddenly had the urge to communicate with the black cat.

[CHOICE] - Switch perspective

In a way that animals could understand, she sent friendly words that she hadn’t said in many years, as well as herself, into the black cat’s mind.

Sa: Hello.


Black Cat: …!

Black Cat: Human, why are you speaking in my head?

The black cat swished its tail and circled the person before it.

Sa: It’s just a little trick. There’s no need to worry about it.

Sa: Tell me, little one, why are you afraid of humans?

Black Cat: I’m not afraid of humans, meow! It’s humans who are afraid of me!

Sa: Why?

Black Cat: Because I’m a black, “omnious” kitty.

Black Cat: While those white and orange friends of mine are always popular. Every time they pass by, humans pet them a bunch of times.

Black Cat: Hmph! Anyway, it’s a good thing that humans are afraid of the dark, dark night.

Black Cat: Because of that, I can play however I see fit during the nighttime.

Black Cat: Humans thineek the roads at night are like… like an “ebyss” or something. Once they stay there for too long, their bodies disappear, leaving only a floating, white, talking thing.

Sa: Oh wait… You meant to say “ominous” and “abyss”, right?

Black Cat: Whatever… I don’t want to understand what humans are thinking, because I can’t understand them anyway. I don’t mind being the only one who likes the night!

Black Cat: It’s cool and quiet. Occasionally, some bold humans become active in the night.

Black Cat: Hmm, in human terms, you could say they’re probably up to… no good?

The black cat raised its paw and casually pointed ahead.

Black Cat: Like those two standing over there…

Cowardly Man: Boss, when will you be ready? Nana said those “Shadowless” people are going to make a move tonight.

Gloomy Man: Will they blast open the impenetrable iron gate or climb over the terrifyingly high walls? Come on! In my opinion, the real passage is in the museum.

Cowardly Man: The museum…? That place is just like the Pillar of Heaven. We can’t go there.

Gloomy Man: Yeah, my old man has been saying that for as long as I can remember, but his theory never convinced me.

Gloomy Man: So later on, I went to ask Grandma Ann, the oldest person in town, but she said the same as my old man.

Gloomy Man: But when I continued to question her about the source of the information, she acted like she was possessed. She couldn’t tell me why, but she firmly believed that both the museum and the Pillar of Heaven were forbidden areas for the people of Phosphorus.

Gloomy Man: But that’s not even the weirdest thing.

Cowardly Man: Huh?

Gloomy Man: Think about it… If the museum was always meant to be a forbidden place, then why is it called a “museum”?

Cowardly Man: …!

Gloomy Man: In the eyes of the people of Phosphorus, the museum has always been nothing more than a small door embedded in the ground.

Gloomy Man: Beneath that small door, there could be an incredibly vast space used to store valuable artifacts, or… it could be a secret passage leading to the Pillar of Heaven outside the city.

Cowardly Man: Impressive, boss! I got it!

Gloomy Man: Either way, our operation will begin tonight.

Sa: …

[CHOICE] - Gaze inward

“As long as I’m the first to uncover the secrets of the ‘museum’ and the ‘Pillar of Heaven’, and find the treasures hidden within, I can eradicate the Shadowless, replace that fool, Penney, and gain control over Phosphorus!”

He was quite pleased with himself, and even began to envision the epitaphs of his two opponents.

“Penney, who is ignorant in life, is only wise in death… No, ‘sober’ would be a better word. As for the Shadowless, perhaps they don’t need an epitaph at all. That would suit their name more, wouldn’t it?”


Sa: …

Concentrating, she branded her words into the depths of the man’s mind.

Fearful Man: …!

Fearful Man: What… what is that?!

The man’s world was suddenly overtaken by throbbing, shifting words, each stroke of them seemingly dipped in his warm blood.

The blood writhed, separating and merging, before finally forming a sentence.

“And you, Cecil, shall become the sinner of Phosphorus forever and more.”

???: …

???: So, this is your reasoning?

???: My divine Creator?

Sa: I don’t mind you understanding it that way.

Proxy: You have sacrificed so much, and now you must start from scratch. Don’t you have any pity?

Sa: Pity?

Her lips curled into a slight smile.

Sa: When you say “pity”, is it for the people of Phosphorus or my fellow beings? Or perhaps for my present self?

Proxy: …

Sa: There’s nothing to regret.

Sa: They’ve already gone bad, which is a fact. Just like a pile of fruit that’s been left out for too long. Even if there is good fruit among them, decay will quickly spread along those in contact.

Sa: Looking back now, I should never have hoped to create a new life for all the consciousness backups in the Soul system.

Sa: The Abyss erased its hope; the Apocalypse bestowed selfishness upon it; while misfortune ultimately led to its demise. Can you expect humans with inferior backups to create an ideal civilisation?

Proxy: So, what are your plans now?

Sa: Tell me, how many sets of human genomes with no backup consciousness loaded remain in the Ark Genetic Repository?

Proxy: 57.

Sa: Very well. Once I enter meditation, help me place them in the catalytic device.

Proxy: And what about the backup consciousness of the Purushians?

Sa: …

She didn’t answer right away.

She suddenly thought of Nana, the enthusiastic girl who left her a kind reminder. Despite their limited interactions, a glimmer of light in the tainted Phosphorus was enough to leave a deep impression.

After a moment of silence, she shifted her focus and began searching for Nana’s figure among the streets and alleyways of Phosphorus.

…

Nana: Brother, I’m sorry, but I didn’t find anything today.

Cecil: Then why did you come back so late?

Nana: Because… because something happened on the way.

Cecil: Was it the Shadowless?

Nana: I don’t know. It seems like it might be related. I encountered someone suspicious, so I approached them and asked where they came from.

Nana: Originally, I thought I could deceive them and bring them to you once I found an opportunity.

Nana: But then… later on… hmm, I’m sorry. Everything that happened then is blurry now. I can’t even remember what that person looked like.

Cecil: ****! What the hell is happening today? How come you can’t remember?!

Sa: …

Proxy: What are you thinking?

Sa: Never mind.

Sa: I just wanted to confirm the results of the examination to avoid any regrets.

Proxy: I understand. However, based on your purpose for creating me, I must remind you of something.

Proxy: If you decide not to load the backup consciousness from the Soul system onto the remaining human genomes, the next generation in Phosphorus will have no connection whatsoever to the “Purushians”.

Proxy: They’ll become entirely new individuals, or more accurately, compatriots of the astronaut from the third planet.

Sa: …

Sa: No, there’s still a connection, of course.

Sa: Those “New Phosphorusians” who haven’t been tainted by inferior backups will be the essential tools for the next experiment and the fertile soil where my cherished seeds shall fruit.

Proxy: …?

Proxy: My divine Creator, your words have become increasingly difficult to understand.

Sa: Proxy, it seems you’ve forgotten something again.

Sa: Even though I don’t possess a physical form, I am still the last Purushian.

Sa: And this time…

Sa: I will abandon my emotions and virtues here.

Sa: In the purified Phosphorus, they will become flawless seeds and the measure of civilisation. Then, they will follow different paths to guide and assist humanity.

Sa: Ultimately, through the unwavering hands of virtue, the civilisation that only exists in dreams will become a reality, and a new Purusha will stand tall across countless realms.

Sa: Until the end of eternity…

Sa: …

Sa: When everything here comes to an end, I will fully join the infinite sea and quietly await the day when the seeds break through the soil.

Sa: I no longer need to live alongside them.

Proxy: What about me? What should I do?

Sa: You know what to do.

Proxy: …?

Proxy: For example…

Proxy: Take the lucky black cat into the museum and destroy the backup consciousness stored in the Soul system?

Sa: Hmm. Fine.

Sa: That’s not important.

Proxy: …

Proxy: …

Proxy: As you will, Sa.

…

“You should know that God’s footsteps are hidden in everything in the world.”

“Renounce desires, do not covet others’ possessions, and you shall experience true joy.”

Otherwise…

Sa: Annihilation shall befall you.

…

Right now…

At the intersection of the proper world and the Sea of Quanta.

In the depths of a certain deity’s consciousness.

When a parasite named “criminal mastermind” began his speech.

???: Oh? Is this your past? It’s rather vivid.

…

???: Got nothing to say? Well, that’s alright. It’s already too late anyway.

???: The seeds you cherished have been estranged, and the fertile soil you nurtured has been contaminated. As a professor, I understand quite well how painful this must be for a student about to receive their graduation certificate.

???: But of course, you still have a chance.

???: That is, to rush from the dormitory you’re reluctant to leave to the academic building, and mete out your most terrifying punishment to the students who are sabotaging the experiment.

???: But, unfortunately, no matter how fast you go, some changes have already taken place and are irreversible.

???: Because the strings that manipulate this drama have never been in your hands.

…

???: Want to guess where it is now?

Gameplay 42-12 - Promised Land

Vita: Yeah…

Vita: What nice weather.

Vita: Let’s see what the representation of the Seeds has turned Phosphorus into.

Boy: What do you think about teddy bears?

Girl: Too childish!

Boy: What about flowers?

Girl: Purple collects them every day, so it’s not surprising at all.

Boy: Hmm… Then I don’t have any more ideas. Honestly, we must give… Ouch, why are you hitting me?

Girl: The celebration is on the day after tomorrow. How can you say that? Usually, it’s Purple who prepares gifts for everyone. So what’s wrong with us preparing one for her?

Girl: You’re just too lazy, aren’t you!

Boy: Um…

Man that Loves Cats: …

Standoffish Black Cat: Meow!

Man that Loves Cats: Blacky, come on! Let Daddy pet you. Daddy’s in a rush today.

Standoffish Black Cat: Meow…

Man that Loves Cats: Fine. I won’t stop trying, even if you don’t want it.

Man that Loves Cats: Kitties like you are born to be petted. Haha…

Standoffish Black Cat: Meow? Meowww!

Woman: I already told you I don’t want to use it. It’s just a scam!

Daughter: Mum! I know you don’t like trying new things, but this is from Blue and Yellow, those two small but very trustworthy city representatives.

Daughter: From now on, you won’t have to carry coins around everywhere.

Woman: Really? It won’t just swallow all my money and display “zero balance” on the screen?

Daughter: Of course it won’t!

Proxy: Oh, I didn’t see that coming.

Proxy: What do you say, my divine Creator?

…

Proxy: Looks like I also need more time to get accustomed to your silence.

Proxy: Anyway, since we rarely come here, you must be eager to check on the seeds, right?

Proxy: I don’t know where they are though, I’m afraid.

Proxy: You can’t expect me to go around all of Phosphorus and ask everyone, “Have you seen seven children who look just like me”, can you?

One of the seven is in the square.

Proxy: …Heh.

Proxy: Okay, copy that. About to head there now!

???: Mister, if there’s ever something you don’t understand, please don’t hesitate to ask me.

???: I’ll be nearby tomorrow…

Proxy: Hi, Cyan!

Cyan: …!

Cyan: Miss Vita… How… how come you are…?

Vita: How come I’m here?

Cyan: Erm… Yes. The last time you said you wouldn’t be back for a while.

Vita: Erm, how should I put it? I missed you, and I also missed Phosphorus. Isn’t that reason enough?

Vita: More specifically, what I miss most is you all calling me “Miss Vita”.

Cyan: Miss Vita…

No more unnecessary words. Take me to see them.

Vita: …

Vita: Alright, no more jokes. Where are your other companions? Where did they all go?

Cyan: They should all be at the museum right now.

Vita: Huh? What are they doing there?

Cyan: The celebration in Phosphorus is coming up, and Purple hopes that everyone can thoroughly clean the museum.

Cyan: There aren’t many exhibits in the museum, and it’s not usually open to the public, not even to ourselves… But it’s still a part of Phosphorus.

Vita: What about you?

Cyan: While they’re cleaning, I’m responsible for maintaining the daily order of Phosphorus.

Vita: Oh… I thought you’d been isolated by everyone.

Vita: Whenever there are three people, there are always two who get along better, right? Perhaps that’s how it feels.

Cyan: Miss Vita, you misunderstand! I… I just thought it would be more appropriate for me to take care of things outside, so I volunteered.

Vita: I see.

Vita: So, are you done with your tasks?

Cyan: Yes, it’s currently the residents’ lunch break, so there shouldn’t be much happening for a while. Miss Vita, let me take you to everyone.

Vita: Okay.

Cyan: …

Vita: …?

Cyan: Miss Vita, how long will you stay in Phosphorus this time?

Vita: Can’t really tell. All depends on my work plan.

Vita: You know it, right?

Cyan: Oh, I thought you were not going anywhere else.

Vita: Well…

Cyan: Vita, here we are.

Vita: Hmm, it’s definitely much cleaner here.

Vita: It seems that a responsible representative is better suited to stay in Phosphorus than a careless cleaner.

…

Cyan: Don’t say that, Miss Vita… You used to handle everything in Phosphorus on your own, so it’s natural to overlook some things.

Cyan: But now we have eight people, we can share many responsibilities.

Vita: Eight, huh…

She chuckled at the words that Cyan mustered up the courage to say, “Since when did I become one of them?” She wondered.

Vita: Sure. I actually have a request that I’ve been struggling to bring up.

Cyan: What is it?

She smiled and remained silent, then suddenly bent down, surveying the empty display case in front of her. There was nothing there, yet she stared at it as if intoxicated.

Many thoughts with peculiar intentions raced through her mind. She patiently chose them briefly before finally voicing the idea that might trigger a change in me.

Vita: Cyan, don’t you think… this place doesn’t resemble a museum?

Cyan: Hmm… In terms of the number of exhibits, it is a bit too empty…

Cyan: …

Cyan: Ah! What if we put the souvenirs you brought back from elsewhere in the museum? Would doing so make it feel like one?

Vita: I think that could work.

Vita: But Cyan, it isn’t enough for you to agree. This museum belongs to everyone, so if you want to do this, you need to convince the others.

Vita: Are you willing to put effort into this?

Cyan: …

The cyan seed didn’t answer immediately. At the same time, voices came from nearby…

???: Cyan!

Cyan: Huh? It’s Red… and everyone else?

Righteous Vita: Cyan, you should’ve told us earlier that Miss Vita was back.

Cyan: W-We just met a moment ago.

Encompassing Vita: Stop complaining, Red. Everyone is happy to see Miss Vita, right?

Veracious Vita: Miss Vita, I missed you so much, and so did everyone else.

Vita: Haha. That means a lot coming from someone like Yellow.

Mindful Vita: That’s mostly because she wants to be praised by you.

Veracious Vita: Blue!

Vita: Alright, why don’t you report on your recent work one by one?

Righteous Vita: I’ll go first!

Righteous Vita: While you were away, I patrolled the streets every day and helped everyone solve all kinds of problems. But… sometimes I ended up being more of a hindrance due to my impulsive nature. Luckily, all’s well that ends well!

As she spoke, the red seed proudly pointed to the small badge on her chest.

It was bright and shiny.

Righteous Vita: Vita, look. The Justice Society gave me this! Hehe, they even said I’m the Great Detective of Phosphorus!

Vita: I think you should consider adopting that title as your profession, Great Detective Red. It suits you.

Righteous Vita: Miss Vita… You’re a genius!!!

Vita: Then, by the color order, it’s little Orange’s turn next.

Encompassing Vita: Miss Vita, I’m writing a new textbook with Blue.

Mindful Vita: The previous textbooks have quite a few errors and omissions, which could hinder Phosphorus’ development.

Mindful Vita: So, I asked Orange to collect feedback and suggestions for revisions from various academies. Then, based on those suggestions, I’m compiling a new textbook.

Vita: The combination of reason and emotion… Hmm, you complement each other perfectly. I suppose it’s this very aspect that made you work partners, right?

Encompassing Vita: Originally, Green was supposed to work with me, but she showed more interest in other tasks, so I asked Blue for help instead.

Vita: Oh? What is Green currently working on then?

Disciplined Vita: I… My progress is a bit slow. I’m still building the framework. I think it would be better to tell you when I have some results to show.

Vita: Alright. But knowing you, I don’t need to worry about that.

Disciplined Vita: …!

Disciplined Vita: Thank you, Miss Vita. I… I’ll do my best.

Vita: I’m also looking forward to your efforts coming to fruition.

Vita: Now, let’s move on… Ah, it’s Yellow’s turn.

Veracious Vita: Me? Erm, the celebration is approaching, so I’ve been helping Purple with checking the buy list and organising the decorations and gifts for it.

Harmonious Vita: As for me, I’ve been carrying out what we planned at the start of the year. Oh yeah, we also prepared some gifts for you, Miss Vita!

Vita: But, what if I can’t make it to the celebration?

Veracious Vita: Then we’ll save the gifts and give them to you when you return! By the way, we’ve already saved up…

Harmonious Vita: Shhhh!

Harmonious Vita: We didn’t do anything. Yeah, nothing at all!

Vita: Okay. Although you didn’t do anything, I’m still very happy.

Cyan: …

Vita: Alright. Last but not least, it’s Cyan’s turn. Cyan, do you have anything you want to share with me?

Cyan: I… I can’t handle the heavy responsibility of managing the city like everyone else…

Because you’re the one who least resembles me among the seven.

Cyan: Every day, I just stare at everyone’s backs and jot down the changes happening across Phosphorus in my notebook. Then I compile them in the morning and evening journals for everyone to read.

Cyan: I’ve just been doing this ordinary task…

Vita: Ordinary? I don’t think it’s ordinary at all.

Vita: It’s just as important as being a cleaner.

…

Vita: Because of your records, everyone can see what the past truly looked like at any given moment. And as we look back, the future of the city will gradually take shape.

Vita: As time sculpts this place, any form of record will emit its own radiance, just like the exhibits in the museum.

Cyan: I understand, Miss Vita.

Cyan: Now that we’re talking about exhibits… I’d like to discuss something else with everyone.

Encompassing Vita: What is it, Cyan?

Cyan: I think we should display the special items that Miss Vita brought back from elsewhere in the museum.

…

I suddenly realised that she succeeded.

Because change was growing rampantly under my watchful gaze.

Nevertheless, after that statement, all the seeds present fell into silence.

After some time, it was the green seed who responded first.

Disciplined Vita: I’m sorry, Cyan, but I don’t agree with your proposal. If Miss Vita can put anything she likes in the empty display cases, then why can’t others?

Veracious Vita: Yeah! I like her, but I don’t like double standards.

Disciplined Vita: More precisely, this museum was built by the city’s founder, and we’re just… the founder’s representatives.

Disciplined Vita: Even though there are only three rules now, I don’t believe we have the authority to arbitrarily add more.

Encompassing Vita: Yes… We should all be more cautious when it comes to rules.

Righteous Vita: Erm, well… Isn’t everyone taking this too seriously?

Mindful Vita: Red, this matter must be discussed seriously. If we make decisions based solely on impulse, then we aren’t very good city representatives.

Righteous Vita: T-Then, let’s vote on it later.

Encompassing Vita: Cyan, what are you thinking now?

Cyan: I understand everyone’s reasoning, but I… I still want to stick to my opinion.

As he spoke, the cyan seed took the key from his chest and held it tightly in his hand, as if by doing so, he could gain more courage.

But I didn’t leave such power within the key.

Cyan: …

Cyan: I feel like this key not only embodies our authority, but also symbolises the trust the city’s founder has in us.

Cyan: If that person truly believed that putting other items in the empty display cases was wrong, then they would have revoked our authority to open the display cases and listed it as a prohibition in the rules, just like they restrict us from entering the forbidden area.

Cyan: But since that’s not the case, there are two possible interpretations of this matter.

Cyan: First, the matter we’re discussing is frankly trivial in the eyes of the city’s founder.

Cyan: Second, the city’s founder wanted their representatives to adapt to all changes happening in Phosphorus at their own discretion, rather than making no headway.

Cyan: Based on what Miss Vita said about the expectations of the city’s founder for Phosphorus and their representatives… I believe the second possibility is more likely.

Disciplined Vita: Hmm…

Mindful Vita: Cyan has a point.

Disciplined Vita: …

Disciplined Vita: Yeah.

…

Vita: Oh?

Vita: (My deity, do you see this? This cyan seed is contemplating your thoughts.)

Vita: (And I guess he’s correct.)

…

Vita: (Humility, the furthest thing from you, has now become the entity that understands you the most. Don’t you find that somewhat thought-provoking?)

You’re too noisy.

Vita: (Okay, I’ll shut up… Oh, I mean stop thinking. But in the end, can anyone really stop th…)

Without warning, a suffocating sensation formed around her slender neck, strangling her neither too tightly nor too loosely.

It was a gentle reminder… a rope that held her life in its grip is controlled by me at every moment.

Vita: …Heh.

Leaving behind an ambiguous chuckle, she redirected her gaze to the main characters of the discussion.

Cyan: Now, let’s talk about the issue of double standards.

Cyan: Perhaps everyone has already noticed that although this place is called a “museum”, it’s actually a warehouse for storing precious artifacts, where both representatives and citizens cannot enter freely unless necessary.

Cyan: Since it’s a warehouse… if we don’t impose restrictions on the people who use it, it will quickly become cluttered.

Veracious Vita: Just like Red’s trash can?

Righteous Vita: Hey!

Cyan: Therefore, without modifying the existing rules, I want to propose a rule for Miss Vita herself.

Cyan: The exhibits that Miss Vita wishes to include must embody the concept of recording. That is to say, they must both represent the past and the present, while also guiding the future.

Cyan: Of course, it’s not enough for Miss Vita to believe so alone. For exhibits to be placed in empty display cases, they must receive the votes of the majority at the assembly.

Disciplined Vita: …I concur.

Veracious Vita: Hmm, so do I.

Encompassing Vita: If there are no objections, then what we just discussed will become the fourth rule of Phosphorus and the first rule independently enacted by the city representatives.

…

Vita: …

She yawned a few times, clearly losing patience with the ongoing discussion.

This was a part of her terrible work attitude: being deeply invested at the start, then quickly cooling after foreseeing the outcome.

There was nothing that could easily change human nature. I was well aware that this moment was no exception.

The examination came to an end with her perfunctory and mechanical responses, and my attention gradually drifted away from the scene.

Until a certain incident occurred…

Vita: …!

Her eyes widened as she stared at the seeds hugging her tightly.

Vita: You…

Vita: What are you doing?

Righteous Vita: Hehe! Miss Vita, I have a little secret to tell you!

Righteous Vita: Cyan was so happy just now, telling me that he really, really likes the new name you gave him after the discussion!

Harmonious Vita: “Although you try hard to conceal your brilliance, you’re still a light.” Ah, you’re always able to come up with such beautiful names for everyone.

Erudite Vita: P-Please, can we not talk about that?

Vita: …

Unfortunately, she never put much effort into it; she mostly named them based on first impressions or spontaneous inspirations. She only saved this one for last because “humility” wasn’t distinct enough.

Vita: …

Her hands hung in the air for a long time, as if they would no longer belong to her if they fell back.

Vita: …

Ask them what they want.

I reminded her.

Resources, knowledge, or authority. Those should be their rewards for passing this stage of the examination.

So she asked…

Vita: What else do you want?

Erudite Vita: Miss Vita, we actually discussed it a long time ago, but we always felt… it was difficult to bring up.

Vita: It’s okay. Consider it a gift for the celebration. You can ask for anything you want.

Erudite Vita: Well…

Erudite Vita: Then we want you to stay with us for a little while longer. Is that okay?

Vita: …

Throughout the long passage of time, apart from the moment of “rebirth”, this was the second time that “she” felt an overwhelming emotion that could shatter her being.

Vita: …

Vita: I…

…

Vita: …!

The expansion just now inadvertently made her crowd out my existence. Therefore, I guided her back into the embrace of the sea.

Proxy, your work at Phosphorus has ended.

Now, it’s time for you to head to the next destination.

Vita: …

Vita: …

Vita: As you will, Sa.

Thus, I left her eyes.

???: However, at that moment, a “transformation” that exceeded everyone’s expectations emerged…

Vita: …

Vita: And when was the third time…?

???: It’s evident that you don’t want this cleaner to have too many interactions with the seeds beyond their work… yet you still chose her.

???: Or perhaps, you could only choose her because she is unique enough… Am I right?

???: Indeed. You can easily perceive and manipulate everything that attaches itself to your root system like an omniscient and almighty deity.

???: But even deities have their troubles.

???: The lusher the foliage of a great tree, the more difficult it becomes to touch the vein of a specific leaf or eradicate a certain pest. Therefore, you need something entirely different from a deity, something free.

???: Ah, it’s truly enviable.

???: After all, I, this resilient pest, have been fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of your past and engage in inconsequential conversations with you. Yet despite this, I remain ignorant of what is happening outside.

…

???: In my view, silence can be a symbol of contemplation for the strong or the final disguise of the weak.

???: I assume you are in the former category, as I seem to have caused you some perplexing thoughts.

???: But in the end, you are too naive, always clinging to something beyond your “divine consciousness”.

???: Otherwise, how could those cherished seeds be exploited by a pest?

???: Ah, now that I think about it. Those so-called “seeds”...

???: Must’ve been meaningless and inessential to a god all along, right?

…

The thoughts he clung to remained undisturbed, but a thunderous roar reverberated from emptiness.

It was Her heavy footfall.

It was the wail of those in distress.

It was the shackles of those who could never attain godhood.

Gameplay 42-13 - Involuntary

Griseo: These Wardens suddenly began attacking again…

Griseo: Is this related to Hua’s disappearance? Or is it…

Griseo: Anyhow, I can’t let them into the Ark and hurt the little Vitas.

Griseo: …Only I can fight now.

Griseo: …

After clearing a group of unwelcome guests, Griseo immediately returned to the corridor to assess the current state of the Ark.

Griseo: It seems safe.

Griseo: …

She approached her bedroom and peered inside from a distance.

Griseo: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven…

Griseo: Thank goodness.

The little Vitas seemed to be diligently adjusting their permissions, oblivious to the events going on outside.

Griseo: (I shouldn’t disturb them for now. So, all that’s left is…)

Griseo: …

Griseo: Vita… Where are you?

Vita: Dear Miss Griseo, my candy won’t grow legs and run away, so I’m still right where you left me.

Griseo: …

Vita: Judging by your expression, I assume all the Paradise Wardens nearby have been taken care of.

Vita: Fortunately, before Fu Hua disappeared, she left my candy in the bedroom for you to pick up, or I wouldn’t have been able to stay here and help you inspect the electronic systems or just chat with you.

Vita: By the way, isn’t the quality of this Ark a bit too good? Thousands, even tens of thousands of years have passed, yet the electronic locks still work. What’s the name of this ship’s designer? Will I get to meet her?

Griseo: …

Griseo: If it wasn’t for the circumstances, I would never team up with someone like you.

Vita: That hurts… We just worked together ten minutes ago.

Griseo: I don’t like liars.

Vita: Since you can “see through the surface”, it doesn’t make much difference whether I tell the truth or not.

Griseo: How could you…

Griseo: …

Griseo: In the museum, you said that you have no attachment to the little Vitas whatsoever.

Vita: Ah yes, and because of that statement, Griseo has come to dislike me even more.

Griseo: You said they are your “creations”...

Vita: But they are also your “creations”. I think it’s absurd to be emotionally attached to them after they’re completed. It only hinders their freedom.

Vita: Ah, right.

Vita: Could this be, little Griseo, your first time facing the newborn “seeds” alone?

Vita: Because in the era when you were a child, there were no more “seeds” that would sprout.

Griseo: …?

Vita: Ah, if we do this here, and then like this… There we go.

Griseo: Hey, Vita. What do you mean?

Vita: It worked! The door is open!

Griseo: …

Griseo: No Fu Hua… and no Paradise Wardens.

Vita: Only the engine room hasn’t been checked, but the chances are slim, right?

Griseo: Yeah, the Troubleshooter also said there are only nine of us here now…

Vita: It seems that Fu Hua truly vanished from the Ark.

Vita: Unfortunately, no one saw what happened. But I guess even if someone had, nothing could be done about it.

Griseo: …

Vita: My Creator is a cautious giant who wouldn’t allow any threats to approach.

Vita: I suspect She disrupted Fu Hua’s projection and banished her to the outside world, which is the mist where Fu Hua and I first met.

Griseo: So can’t you just find a way to return there now?

Vita: Unfortunately, my true form is no longer there.

Vita: That Whatever-arty caused such a commotion that it even alerted the Creator. As a little deserter, it’s unlikely for Her to notice me, but if I’m exposed, I’m done for good.

Vita: So I transferred my true form and hid deeper and farther away.

Griseo: Even so…

Vita: If Miss Griseo were to ask, I may consider venturing back.

Griseo: …

Vita: I’m just kidding. I can’t return now even if I wanted to.

Vita: Blame that exhibit called Whatever-arty who messed around with the stolen permissions by the waterfall. Restoring the positioning system between those spaces would take several days, I think.

Griseo: You’re stretching the truth a bit much.

Vita: Sometimes, the truth can be quite far-fetched.

Griseo: …

Griseo realised that continuing to argue with Vita would be pointless.

Griseo: Let’s investigate the engine room first. It’s the last unknown area of the Ark.

Griseo: If there are any threats there, we need to eliminate them as soon as possible to keep the little Vitas safe.

Vita: You really are a worrywart, Griseo…

???: That’s right, Griseo. We aren’t that helpless!

Griseo: Red? You came?

Disciplined Vita: Yes, we finished debugging. We’re now confident we can transfer the permissions without any errors.

Erudite Vita: But, it seems like there’s a new problem on your end…

Veracious Vita: We overheard you saying that you can’t find Fu Hua.

Righteous Vita: Finding people is what we’re best at! Let us help, Griseo!

Griseo: …I suppose it’s better if we work together. Come with me, then.

Griseo: Sa may have reconfigured the Ark… I should reconfigure it to be safe.

…

Griseo: Sounds like it worked.

Righteous Vita: We’re here, so of course it’d work.

Disciplined Vita: Let’s head to the engine room.

Harmonious Vita: Oh no! Are Paradise Wardens also interested in the data center?

Griseo: Everyone, stand back.

Griseo: …

The engine room was filled with neatly arranged machines, just as it had been before Griseo went into her slumber. There were no holes in the walls or the ceiling.

Fu Hua was, of course, not there, and the destroyed Paradise Wardens weren’t deliberately hiding in wait.

Griseo: …

Griseo: (The priority is to find Hua, but I haven’t seen that crucial mist yet…)

Griseo: (Wait, Vita told me most of the information about the mist.)

Griseo: (What is she…)

When Griseo glanced at the focus of the matter, which was Vita, she suddenly noticed her hands’ subtle movements.

Griseo: Vita, what are you doing?!

Reflexively, she stepped forward to grab Vita’s hand that was operating the input interface, only to grab thin air.

Vita: I told you I’m a projection possessing the candy, so you don’t need to worry so much, alright? My existing here is proof that Fu Hua hasn’t encountered any major danger.

Vita: Oh, speaking of which… were you going to ask me something just now?

Griseo: Why are you inputting the Ark’s data into your projection terminal?

Vita: Ah, that. I’m just backing up the Ark administrator’s authentication. It won’t cause you any harm.

As if it was no big deal, Vita calmly admitted to her little act of thievery.

Griseo: You… Why are you backing it up? Is it related to our operations?

Vita: Well, if you really must know… then maybe it is?

Vita: Think about it. We can’t find Fu Hua, right? SInce we can’t find her, we must be prepared for the worst.

Vita: In other words, we can’t resist the Creator nor prevent the flood of annihilation on our own. When that happens, everything, including this cracked-open part of the Ark, will be submerged.

Vita: When that happens, only one person can survive.

Vita: That’s you, Griseo.

Griseo: I…

Vita: You’ve already slept through countless cycles inside the Ark. So that means the damage from the flood has no effect on you. Or rather, it will bypass you.

Vita: As for my theory… I’m guessing the Creator has adopted a mechanism similar to “whitelisting”. You know, she’s already expanded to such an extreme extent, so She has to rely on this mechanism or that to get things done. Otherwise, She’d even have problems concentrating.

Vita: Everything that belongs to Phosphorus must be completely destroyed by the flood, reset, and prepared for a new round of experiments.

Vita: But you aren’t a part of Phosphorus. You’re a more unique specimen. I suspect that even if the Ark is submerged by the flood, you’ll still be sheltered by the Creator and remain unharmed.

Griseo: …

Vita: That made me think this thing might be my “life jacket”. Griseo, you wouldn’t be so stingy as to not share this lifesaver with me, would you?

Griseo: I don’t mind, but I do mind something else. When did you start planning this?

Vita: Oh, it’s just an idea that popped into my head after entering the room.

Griseo: (She took advantage of my distrust and deliberately uttered nonsense at the time. She probably decided to replicate my authentication long ago.)

Griseo: (But she’s just a projection. Even if her original self can never return to Phosphorus, for her, it seems that…)

Erudite Vita: Griseo? Miss Vita?

Encompassing Vita: What are you two whispering about? Does it have something to do with Fu Hua’s whereabouts? We want to hear, too.

Griseo: Uh…

Vita: And each time, it’s me, poor little Vita, who’s responsible for rescuing everyone from the flood, drying them off, and restoring their memories.

Vita: It’s a really tough job. If it wasn’t for me, everyone would be floundering in the water.

Griseo: (What if she’s actually doing it for…?)

Griseo: (No, that’s impossible. She said herself that she doesn’t care about the fate of her creations once they are completed.)

Vita: It’s me who discovered a new clue!

Griseo: …?

Vita turned to the side so Griseo and the little Vitas could see the text on the monitor.

Griseo: Retrieving log…

Mindful Vita: The access name is “Moriarty”?

Once more, that name haunted them.

And that also meant…

Before dissipating, he managed to obtain the Ark administrator’s authentication.

--

Gameplay 42-14 - Finding Freedom Within

Meanwhile, on the other side of the predicament…

The mist reached out in all directions. To avoid getting lost, Fu Hua left a small road sign in the space before she set out.

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: …I can’t.

Fu Hua: Are there no visible “bugs” this time?

Fu Hua: But the feeling of being here is similar to before. According to Vita, it’s called the “Path of the Fairy”, right?

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: I need to sort things out first.

Fu Hua: I attempted to channel the power of Active Honkai Reaction on the Ark, but was immediately interfered with by some foreign will.

Fu Hua: That could only be the Creator, Sa. This indicates that She is capable of responding to threats that are sufficiently powerful or unusual in real time.

Fu Hua: When I tried to do so, I immediately became a target for the Creator, much like a sudden burst of light in darkness. She disrupted my projection and threw me back into this mist.

Fu Hua: Therefore, it’s unwise to confront the Creator by relying entirely on unfamiliar powers. To defeat Sa, I need complete control over this projection, not just Vita’s assistance.

Fu Hua: …

Taking the present into consideration, Fu Hua had been thrown into this mist three times, either voluntarily or involuntarily.

For the first two times, she managed to leave this place by rending “bugs” open and even bring the hitchhiker Vita back to Phosphorus.

However, this time, without Vita’s guidance, finding a new “bug” had become nigh impossible.

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: If the previous method of leaving is no longer viable, then perhaps I should try to analyse how I “entered” on a principle level.

The first instance occurred when Fu Hua had just entered the forbidden area, which led her to believe the mist was a normal occurrence.

Later, she encountered a mysterious person claiming to be Vi and eventually saw through her deception. That was when she realised the mist was not a tangible space, for it could even overlap the interior of the Ark.

Just like a real mist, it enveloped the Ark, preventing Fu Hua from seeing and altering reality.

Fu Hua: Afterward, Griseo used her ability to reveal that my existence on this planet is a projection, which broadly speaking is a deception.

However, unlike Vita who hitchhiked, Fu Hua’s projection can experience life in Phosphorus and even battle enemies.

Fu Hua: …Could I be existing in a similar way to the Herrscher of Sentience?

If Fu Hua continued along this line of thought, she might consider the projection as an independent “sense”. An unknown entity opened up a sixth sense for her, and as a result, she experienced an action at a distance from a distant planet.

Fu Hua: And the mist served as a barrier to that perception, trapping eme here when the projection is unstable.

The first time, Fu Hua encountered some kind of interference when entering the forbidden area and later the mist.

The second time, Fu Hua was ambushed by Moriarty near the waterfall, and her projection was thrown out of the museum’s world… before entering the mist again.

Fu Hua: Moriarty probably didn’t plan that, as he didn’t expect me to return. So perhaps the mist didn’t trap me but rather “caught” me as I fell down the waterfall?

Now, Fu Hua was thrown into the mist for the third time. As she tried to activate the power of Garuda, she was targeted and interfered by Sa.

However, even with Sa’s immense power and the element of surprise, Fu Hua’s projection couldn’t be destroyed. She simply ended up in this mist once more.

Fu Hua: If Sa is truly a Creator, then her current actions are quite ineffective. I suspect, like Moriarty, that Sa didn’t intend to throw me into the mist.

In that case, the mist was comparable to a safety rope tied to Fu Hua.

Fu Hua: That could also explain why Vita wants to take control of my projection. She already discovered that the person who constructed my projection could only ensure its strength but had no control over its movement or form.

Fu Hua: So, even if she were to take away my projection, there would be no need to worry about being forcefully expelled.

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: Ultimately, everything leads to the same question… Who is constructing my projection in this form? And for what?

Fu Hua: That person must possess enough power to create a private pathway from Earth to the edge of the solar system. However, they’re also unable to interfere with or support my projection on a physical level.

Fu Hua: That person’s like a catalyst, securing the necessary conditions of sending me here, and then…

Fu Hua: (Wait a minute… That sounds familiar.)

Fu Hua: Oh right, when I left Earth for the first time…

Fu Hua: (...Could it be that the voice is attempting to steer my thoughts?)

???: Exactly, the voice is attempting to steer your thoughts. Because that’s a necessary condition for something to happen.

Fu Hua: The voice said it was the one who guided me here.

Fu Hua felt an answer echoing in her mind. This answer was cursory and illogical, to the point of being unbelievable.

However, at this moment, it stubbornly sprouted from within her, accompanied by vivid and tangible pulsations.

Fu Hua: Capable of reading my inner thoughts, able to direct my train of thought, and clearly not the Herrscher of Sentience.

Fu Hua: Someone who can control things here, set up the necessary conditions for me, but not directly intervene.

Fu Hua: Someone who gave me this power but seems to have no desires or demands, protecting me unilaterally and even leaving behind notes specifically for me to read in the mist.

The answer was on the verge of emerging. Just as Fu Hua reached a conclusion, a sense founded on synchronised thoughts was greatly enhanced.

Fu Hua: …

Just as I thought, you’re right here.


…

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: Su.

A gentle breeze wafted from within the depths of the mist, carrying a contented chuckle and a faint fragrance reminiscent of Bodhi leaves.

Yes. Here I am, as always.

It’s been a while, Hua.

An old comrade, seemingly lost forever, reappeared before Fu Hua.

Incredible as it may seem, she experienced such a reunion twice in one “day”.

Su: I’m glad to see you and Griseo are both safe and sound.

Fu Hua: I should be saying that. Based on the stories Durandal told me, I thought you’d never return to the observable world…

Su: Indeed, Hua. However, observing isn’t always a two-way street. Currently, I can still see your world and your every move.

Su: …Even when you and Keven transcended the Finality.

Su: However, it is not until now that I have had the opportunity to say to you and your comrades: thank you.

Fu Hua: It’s neither “me” nor “my comrades”.

Fu Hua: It’s “us”, Su.

Su: …

Fu Hua: Honestly, when you finally appeared, I couldn’t believe I’d reunite with two old friends in such a short time.

Fu Hua: But after reflecting on the matter, it’s clearly not a coincidence. Because it was you who guided me here to reunite with Griseo.

Fu Hua: Even now, you’re still observing our world and quietly stepping in when needed. You projected me to Phosphorus because you wanted me to save Griseo, right?

Su: Your thinking is correct, Hua. There are just several misconceptions that need correcting.

Su: As you know, I have long departed from the proper world. It’s like I’ve turned into this floating “Prayer Lantern” with the powerful ability to overlook the land but unable to touch a single blade of grass.

Su: I can only intervene in this world in very limited ways, and mostly by one-way methods. Therefore, it wasn’t my intention to guide you indirectly or project you without explanation.

Su: We can only chat like this when you sense my presence through your thoughts and feelings.

Su: So…

Su: Well done, Hua.

Through the translucent leaves, a reassuring message from an old comrade reached her. It felt like he already had the answer long before the observation even started.

Fu Hua: …I see.

Fu Hua: So, has Griseo always been under your observation?

Su: Technically, not from the get-go. I couldn’t observe a planet so distant at first, but as I got the hang of it, the spatial constraints on me gradually loosened up.

Su: It’s just… there was nothing I could do to help her. On this planet, except for her slumbering self, I could not influence anything.

Fu Hua: You mean…

Su: If we say the boundary is the perishing of physical body, then my interventions are restricted to the objects I touched during my “lifetime”. They’re the anchors I’ve left in this world, marking the delicate connection between me and the proper world.

Su: In fact, these anchors are declining as well. Inevitably, I will completely depart from this world. Fortunately, this process takes time.

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: Is this why you sent me here while you still had enough power?

Su: That’s one of the reasons. More importantly, it was the activity of our enemy, Sa.

Fu Hua: …?

Su: You probably know the basics. Sa’s basic abilities are like those of my past self. However, She has been lurking in the depths of the Sea of Quanta, carelessly siphoning energy and expanding without limit. Right now, She is like an insatiable giant crystal orchid.

Su: Ever since I first observed her, She’s been growing nonstop.

Su: It’s been a constant threat to Earth, but before transcending the Finality, this threat evidently lacked the gravity of a grave threat.

Fu Hua: But now things are different.

Su: Yes, they are. Those tendrils of Sa spreading through the world’s crevices are showing signs of loosening up. They are even starting to intervene in bubble universes originating from Earth.

Su: While I can observe time, the future still eludes me. Once observe, the “reality in the box” is set. Therefore, I can only gaze into the world, discerning these rare fluctuations and nebulous possibilities.

Su: This might be an opportune moment, and quite possibly, the final one. Hence, I projected you to where Sa’s physical form was expected to emerge.

Su: But since I didn’t fill you in on the whole situation, the projection may not be that stable.

Fu Hua: But you helped the projection to recreate different mes from different times. Without your help, waking up Griseo would’ve been impossible.

Su: It’s a bit like drafting soldiers and equipping them with high-end gear.

Su: In any case, I am sorry for my arbitrary actions and impoliteness.

Su: The truth is, I picked you out of my personal preference.

Fu Hua: …?

Su: While the entities I can influence are rare, they are by no means exclusive.

Su: Take the Person of Equinox with the Anchora for example, she’s our successor in this era. We talked with each other in the Seed of Sumeru, and there are some connections between us.

Su: Also, there’s the Herrscher who once shared the same body with you. Although the connection between us is indirect, I can still influence her.

Su: Yet, sending a projection to such a distant location was rather challenging. I had to make a choice.

Su: So, in the end, I chose you, my old comrade. Not as a result of intricate calculations, but simply because I know you better.

Fu Hua: Su…

Su: Of course, I have no right to decide for you, especially considering the risks that lie ahead.

Su: Therefore, I’ve managed to convince the Herrscher of Sentience. After getting through her own trials since parting with you, she has now safely returned to Earth.

Su: With her mental abilities, it should’ve been easier for her to detect my presence… yet, her unique personality complicated the matter.

Su: Thankfully, we reached an agreement. Hua, if you want to leave this conflict behind and return to Earth, I can use her as an anchor and send your projection back.

Su: As for the successor of this mission, I’d speak to Durandal and ask if she’s willing.

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: Thanks for the offer, Su.

Fu Hua: But you already know what my answer is, right?

Fu Hua: After all, like you said, you chose me because you knew me better.

Su: …

After a brief silence, the observer chuckled with a somewhat relieved tone.

Su: Yeah… I know.

Fu Hua: Well then, let’s move on to the next topic.

Fu Hua: I was detected by Sa, expelled from that world, and cast into this mist. But before that, someone showed me a way to slip out of here by expanding the bugs.

Su: Unfortunately, that trick doesn’t work anymore.

Su: In the past, you only faced minor disruptions. But this time, Sa Herself directly rejected the projection.

Su: As you figured out, I cannot currently intervene in this process. Think of me as a leaf floating on the lake surface. I was able to hold myself against the breeze before, but a strong force has pushed me deep into the water.

Fu Hua: So, what do we do now?

Su: Don’t worry. The reason I can’t directly intervene and carve a new path for you is because of my unique form of existence.

Su: My sole mission is to observe. Having this conversation with you is already a miracle.

Su: And you’ve got more allies other than me. There is someone else who can guide you.

Su: Moreover, she can offer you a genuinely viable “battle plan”.

Fu Hua: Her?

Su: You will meet soon, Hua. You will understand when that time comes.

Fu Hua: Su…

Su: Say hello to Griseo for me. You will need to carve a path into the future together.

Su: I know you two can do it.

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: I’ll go in this direction for now…

Fu Hua: …!

Fu Hua: Seeds of Ideas? What are they doing here?

???: Oh dear, sorry, I think there was a tiny mistake…

???: I’ll help you capture them…

???: Take it as an apology, Fu Hua.

Amid the pale mist, a figure with a cryptic smile suddenly materialised.

Misteln: Apologies, these kids got a bit too excited about this long-distance trip.

Misteln: Or maybe it’s the “difference” between you and this space that got them all excited? Either way, it’s all just a misunderstanding. I hope you won’t take it to heart.

Fu Hua: You’re… the Schariac’s…

Misteln: Come to think of it, this is your first time seeing me in person despite knowing each other for a long time, right?

Misteln: Do we need to go through the whole social niceties thing, Fu Hua?

Fu Hua: There’s no need, I recognise you. Misteln. Or, should I call you Hare?

Fu Hua: What brought you here?

Misteln: Well, it’s a long story.

Misteln: It started with me chasing a shady and formidable enemy… but mid-mission, I encountered an unexpected twist and got a new mission.

Misteln: The path of life isn’t as straightforward as one would think.

Fu Hua: Who’s this formidable enemy of yours?

Misteln: She used to be my enemy, but for you, Miss Fu Hua, she might be an ally now.

Fu Hua: Do you mean… Vita?

Misteln: Actually, we had some sort of a partnership with that woman, only for her, betrayal is as natural as breathing.

Misteln: Me, No. 17, Seele, the Herrscher of Sentience, and a bunch more… all of them have fallen into her trap before.

Misteln briefly recounted the group’s encounter in Salt Snow Holy City. But she downplayed the ending, which seemed to be her own speculation.

Fu Hua: I see… no wonder she claimed to know Seele.

Fu Hua: But she did some sketchy stuff right after showing up, so our partnership was initially built on temporary common goals.

As she said this, Fu Hua suddenly realised that her incomplete trust of Vita also stemmed from her strange behavior during their first encounter.

Fu Hua: (Wait… does this mean that this incomplete trust was actually in Vita’s favor?)

Misteln: In any case, based on my previous theory, I must have been sent here to help you get out of your current predicament and reunite you with your companions.

Fu Hua: “Must have”?

Misteln: It’s sort of like the Eighth Sense? Ideas are not just a summation of human knowledge. In extremely rare situations, certain a priori knowledge from beyond the world can also be gained. As I understand it…

Misteln: Many civilisations in the universe give rise to lifeforms similar to Ideas. Although we can’t directly communicate, we can discover traces of each other in the crevices of the world.

Misteln: Just like how I woke up at the perfect moment and encountered you.

Fu Hua: (Is she referring to… Su?)

Misteln: No worries. Your lifeform is completely different from Ideas. It’s perfectly fine if you can’t tell Manas from Alaya. Let’s stick to the issue at hand…

Misteln: Before this, I sent some “spies” to scout out the situation on your side. So, shall we proceed directly to the battle plan? For instance, I could serve as the vanguard and pave the way for you.

Fu Hua: But, judging from what you said, you’ve been hurt badly recently and are weaker in many ways.

Misteln: Huh?

Fu Hua: Don’t get me wrong, Miss Misteln. I’m not questioning your abilities. I’m just concerned about your current situation.

The Idea grinned like she had just pulled off a heist.

Misteln: So, that’s what’s on your mind? Don’t worry, Fu Hua…

Misteln: If you wish, I’m always ready to show you what I can do.

…!

Fu Hua: …?

Fu Hua: (Why are they suddenly attacking?)

Fu Hua: (These moves… They’re directed at me, but somehow don’t feel malicious…)

Fu Hua: (And when my fists make contact… it feels like something else…)

Fu Hua: Hey, Misteln?

Misteln: …Shhh.

Fu Hua: The space has changed?

Fu Hua: I see. You just love beating around the bush, don’t you?

Misteln: Mm-hmm~

Fu Hua: Well then, I’ll do it in one effort…

…

Following the tempo of their attacks, the mist-woven space began to loosen up.

In the crevices between the Sea of Quanta and the proper world, the phenomenon of the overlapping dimensions began to change because of the Idea’s entry.

And Su, who noticed this change, decided to inscribe a novel revelation on a distant planet.

Soon after…

Fu Hua: Found it!

Fu Hua: Yes, that’s the direction.

Gameplay 42-15 - A Pure Heart

Meanwhile, Griseo and the Vitas were still looking for a direction…

Vita: They’re like pests in trees, too numerous to wipe out.

Vita: But our Griseo has become more and more reliable.

Griseo: That’s because you aren’t reliable at all.

Vita: You don’t have to tire yourself for me. Of course, I’m very touched.

Griseo: I don’t know how Fu Hua was able to bear with you.

Griseo: …!

[CG plays wherein Fu Hua arrives back from the misty plane, destroying the Paradise Warden Griseo was fighting in the process:

Fu Hua: I’m back, Griseo.]

Griseo: Fu Hua!

Griseo: It’s good to see you’re okay.

???: It took a while, but we arrived just in time.

Fu Hua: Yeah, thanks.

Griseo: Huh? Who’s the lady with white hair…?

???: Lady? I’m much younger than you, if you must know. Anyway, it’s a pleasure to meet you. Just call me Misteln.

Following Misteln’s introduction, Vita, who was supposed to remain in her candy-like form, unexpectedly switched to her regular projection.

Vita: What a reunion.

Vita: Wouldn’t you agree, Miss Misteln Schariac?

Misteln: So, that name left an impression on you, Vita? I figured you’d completely forgotten the recent events.

Vita: How could I? After all, you left behind some rather memorable “last words” for me. But looking at your current condition, they seem a bit… overdramatic?

Misteln: Who could’ve known back then? At that time, I had genuinely decided to face death.

Misteln: It’s just, that even with all your wisdom and power back then, you still couldn’t foresee this outcome, huh?

Vita: Hehe, but I still believe I’ve accomplished what I set out to do.

Misteln: Well, congrats. Sadly, I’m not as clever. I can only use myself as a guiding target.

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: So, is this the principle behind our escape, Misteln?

Fu Hua: As a wanderer passing through that mist, you embedded the Seeds of Ideas into the Path of the Fairy’s weak spot with the help of your extra senses, then used my attacks to forge a new path.

Misteln: Yes. You hit the nail on the head. It worked like a catalyst.

Misteln: Not long ago, I ditched my physical form and infiltrated an energy torrent generated by directional blasting to locate Sa.

Misteln: However, perhaps She discovered me… just when I was about to succeed, the whole energy highway caved in.

Misteln: Bummer, right? I was so close. If I’d had a “life jacket” or a “camo suit” back then, who knows…? Maybe we wouldn’t be stressing about how to deal with Sa right now.

Misteln: But just when things looked bleak, I felt a presence. It was an energy surfer zipping through the currents as if chasing something.

Misteln: On pure instinct, I threw out my hand as she cruised past me, and bam! Everyone saw what happened.

Misteln: I hitched a ride, which turned me into Fu Hua’s sidekick at the crucial moment.

Vita: You seem pretty chuffed about it, but how does someone who claims to have ditched their physical form still have a human body? You’re outshining me here.

Misteln: Well, let’s just call it a “blessing in disguise”.

Misteln: That energy flow cut off my connection to Stigmata Space, so losing my physical form doesn’t mean I can only go back to Stigmata Space like before.

Misteln: Now, I can exist in an intermediary form, something similar to a digital being, and strut around the real world. I can even venture out into the far reaches of the solar system.

Misteln: And guess what? The once great barriers between Ideas and death are now history.

Vita: So, considering all that, you’re pretty much an ordinary person with a sprinkle of special sauce. You’re kind of like that Moriarty we saw, right? The exhibit?

Misteln: I really like that definition. For real.

Vita: …?

Misteln blinked and shot Vita a grin.

Misteln: Vita, in my farewell note, I only mentioned my family name to you and never explained the origin of my given name, right?

Vita: Hmm?

Misteln: It came from an old friend.

Misteln: In some legends, it represents life; but in others, it connotes death.

Misteln: For the old me, it was a fitting name, in the sense that it meant taking life and bestowing death.

Misteln: But fortunately, thanks to my current choices, its significance is no longer dependent on others but resides within me. How could that not be a cause for celebration?

Vita: You’re a weirdo.

Misteln: I guess…

???: The air is a bit tense between them…

???: So, what do you guys think? Should I…

???: Ouch!

…

Following the noise toward the control room’s entrance, there were a bunch of miniature figures stacked up, seemingly struggling to see what was going on.

Griseo: …!

Vita quickly helped Red and Yellow up. But when she reached for the third one, she suddenly hesitated for a moment.

Her hand went straight through Purple’s body as it stopped at an awkward position. When Purple looked at her, Vita quickly withdrew her hand.

Vita: Oh, my bad. I’m still just a piece of candy.

Harmonious Vita: It’s okay, Miss Vita. I can get up on my own.

Vita: …Of course.

After the unexpected interruption, everyone quickly understood what was going on.

Righteous Vita: S-Sorry. It’s all my fault…

Veracious Vita: We shouldn’t have crowded together like that…

Encompassing Vita: Sorry, I didn’t watch them carefully.

Fu Hua: It’s not a big deal. Are any of you hurt?

Erudite Vita: Don’t sweat it, Fu Hua. A minor stumble like that won’t endanger the permission transfer.

Disciplined Vita: Yeah, everyone’s here anyway. How about we start…

Vita: Hold up, Green.

Disciplined Vita: What’s wrong, Miss Vita?

Vita: I just had a wild thought… Maybe before the potential “final showdown”, we should all take a breather?

Vita: I haven’t really done much, so I’m not exactly tired. But our warriors, Fu Hua and Griseo, have been fighting for quite some time.

Griseo: …

Fu Hua: Why the sudden urge to hit the brakes?

Vita: Erm… I just thought that everyone should be in their best shape before challenging what’s forbidden in this world, ya know?

Vita: Don’t worry. As long as we steer clear of the Creator’s gaze and avoid those blacklisted things, we should be fine. She reacts slower than a turtle, after all.

Vita: But truth be told, I have no idea what’s on Her blacklist. If “chilling out before challenging the deity’s authority” is on it, then my suggestion might backfire big time.

Fu Hua: …

Misteln: So, how about a 30-minute break? I have some things to prepare anyway.

Mindful Vita: “30 minutes”...? Is that in your time or Phosphorus’ time?

Fu Hua: Phosphorus’ time is fine.

Fu Hua: Once the break is over, let’s meet up on the bridge with the broken window. That place has a better view to check out the flood.

Fu Hua: Also, if any of you need anything during the break, feel free to ask me. I won’t go far.

Encompassing Vita: In that case, Griseo, can you hand me the candy that Miss Vita is in?

Encompassing Vita: Cyan and I want to chat with Miss Vita privately.

Griseo: Sure. How about you go chat in my room?

Erudite Vita: Huh…? Is that appropriate?

Griseo: My room is quiet and perfect for a chat. Plus, Vita’s technically a regular there, right?

Vita: Well…

Encompassing Vita: Haha, then thanks, Griseo.

Erudite Vita: So, Miss Vita, are you up for it?

Vita: Of course, why would I turn down my own cute family?

Griseo: …

Griseo: If Vita wasn’t posturing, then this might be… the last calm before the storm.

[CHOICE] - Rest


Griseo: I’m not tired… I’ll go check on the others.

Harmonious Vita: Blue, are you alright?

Mindful Vita: I…

Mindful Vita: I… I’m feeling a bit…

Mindful Vita: Sorry… I couldn’t come up with a better solution. It’s my fault.

Disciplined Vita: There’s no need to apologise, Blue. You’ve done your best. Making decisions like that is no walk in the park for anyone.

Disciplined Vita: Listen… You don’t always have to put on a brave face for everyone. Anxiety, fear… they’re all regular emotions.

Disciplined Vita: It might not sound very convincing coming from me, since we two are just alike, but I hope you can lean on us a bit more at moments like these.

Harmonious Vita: Yeah! No matter what lies ahead, we’ll face it together.

Harmonious Vita: If… if you still feel upset, just close your eyes and take a short break. Recharge a bit. Perhaps your mood will improve.

Harmonious Vita: ♪~

Mindful Vita: You’re right. Thank you.

Griseo: (...)

Griseo: (Now’s not the best time to get involved.)

Misteln leaned against a wall, seemingly lost in some kind of meditative state.

Meanwhile, not far away, Red and Yellow tilted their heads, eyeing each other curiously.

Righteous Vita: M-Milns? No, it’s Misln… Forget it! Let’s just call her Hare!

Veracious Vita: Why Hare? Is she actually a long-legged fast-running rabbit?

Righteous Vita: No, dummy. Hare’s just her code name. Just like how I’m the Patroller.

Veracious Vita: But your code name sounds super plain in comparison.

Righteous Vita: Well, I could’ve come up with something a hundred times cooler before handing over permissions.

Veracious Vita: If it’s Red…

Veracious Vita: Then I don’t believe it.

Griseo: Haha…

Griseo: (Although I didn’t relate to much of what everyone just talked about, Misteln and Vita seem to have unresolved issues. Her relationship with Hua is also quite delicate, and…)

Griseo: (Huh? Maybe I’ve been asleep for too long. It feels like I missed out on a lot.)

Griseo: (Once this is all over, I need to find a chance to ask them and clear things up.)

Fu Hua: Hey, Griseo. Shouldn’t you be resting?

Griseo: Shouldn’t you be too, Fu Hua?

Fu Hua: I’m looking for a quiet spot to clear my head and relax my body. That’s my kind of break.

Fu Hua: Oh, by the way…

Griseo: Huh?

Fu Hua: While I was away, I ran into Su. He asked me to say hi to you.

Griseo: …!

Fu Hua explained Su’s situation to Griseo.

Griseo: So, Uncle Su has been keeping an eye on everyone this whole time?

Fu Hua: That’s why he wanted me to say hi to you, I think.

Fu Hua: Even though we’re all on our own paths, we’re never truly alone.

Fu Hua: And that’s how it’ll be moving forward.

Griseo: …Yeah.

There was no need for them to say anything else to each other.

In that moment, similar memories converged in their hearts.

For Griseo, it was the institute’s building, free sodas in the lab, specimens in the museum, dried flowers in dictionaries, oak trees on the base’s lawn, and snails and earthworms under the cement bricks.

For Fu Hua, it was the newly paved asphalt on the tree-lined road, tadpoles in the rice paddies, tilted but sturdy cement poles by the side of the road, her father during morning exercises, and the bowl of noodles she shared with friends.

And at the end of those memories was the wasteland that tied all their destinies together. A land devoid of life and tainted by Honkai energy, where humanity’s last hope and trust stood tall.

The Ark may have just one pilot.

But the civilisation supporting it possessed the nostalgia of everyone on that blue planet.

They couldn’t turn back time.

But, that was because…

The past was just a collection of still frames.

And they’d keep walking toward a new future together.

Griseo: …It’s almost time. Let’s go to the bridge.

Griseo: I wonder how Orange and Cyan are doing.

Not long ago, in Griseo’s room…

Erudite Vita: …

Encompassing Vita: …

Vita: …

Erudite Vita: Oh…

Cyan lifted his head and checked the clock on the bulkhead.

There was still 26 minutes to go.

Vita: …

Vita: Ah, Griseo sure has a big heart, doesn’t she? She knows I’m a free spirit, yet she willingly gave me her room.

While saying this, Vita strolled over to the bed near the bulkhead. Then, much to the surprise of Cyan and Orange, she casually sat down as if she owned the place.

It felt somewhat unnecessary for just a holographic projection.

Vita: Cyan, Orange, do you plan to stand there the whole time while we chat?

Erudite Vita: Miss Vita, isn’t this a bit inappropriate? This is Griseo’s bed…

Vita: Don’t act like you two haven’t laid on it before.

Erudite Vita: Uh…

Vita: And, if I remember correctly, someone here once said, “Can I live here forever?”

Encompassing Vita: I…

Vita: Alright, come sit. Griseo isn’t the petty type.

After a moment of hesitation, the two followed Vita’s lead. As they sat down, Cyan glanced at the clock again.

There were still 20 minutes left.

Erudite Vita: …

Encompassing Vita: …

Erudite Vita: Miss Vita, did you know Hare before?

Vita: Why are you asking?

Erudite Vita: Because… you two don’t seem to get along, and you just mentioned a “farewell note”.

Vita: Oh yeah? It seems everyone overheard our conversation.

Vita: So, do you think I’m a bad person?

Encompassing Vita: Of course not! Miss Vita, you’re definitely not bad!

Vita: …

Vita: You’re right. For you guys, I probably don’t qualify as a bad person.

Vita: But let’s speculate for a moment. What if… I really am bad?

Erudite Vita: …!

Vita: If I’m genuinely a bad person, would you still call me “Miss Vita”, sit next to me, and talk to me?

Encompassing Vita: …

Vita: Oh, I see. So, your trust and reliance on me… are all hinged on “Miss Vita being a good person”.

Vita: Of course, if this trust could be fulfilled by someone else, like Fu Hua, Griseo, or that Whatever-arty, you’d place the same amount of trust in them. That is your “virtue”.

Erudite Vita: I… We…

As they panicked, time kept ticking away.

13 minutes remained.

Erudite Vita: It’s not like that!

Vita: …

Erudite Vita: We trust and rely on you, Miss Vita, because you’re “Miss Vita”, our family. It has nothing to do with whether you’re a good person or not!

Erudite Vita: Perhaps you’re right. Although we’ve left our next, we’re still little fledglings that haven’t fully grown. The first person we encounter easily becomes the person we trust dearly.

Erudite Vita: So, perhaps we overlook those who have always taken care of us.

Encompassing Vita: …

Encompassing Vita: In those past cycles, I was in charge of “education”. So, I know how challenging it is to teach students like us who easily forget.

Encompassing Vita: Names, responsibilities, rules, city founders, and the citizens’ expectations… Each time, you’d patiently repeat them.

Encompassing Vita: And you’d also listen and respond over and over again to similar complaints and confusions. Even for those old celebrations and festivals, you’d bring each of us a special gift.

Encompassing Vita: This isn’t something any “patient” teacher can easily do.

Encompassing Vita: This is something only “Miss Vita” can do.

Encompassing Vita: So…

Encompassing Vita: Sorry, Miss Vita. If we were more mature and cautious, perhaps things wouldn’t have turned out like they did today…

Vita: Did you bring me here just to share this?

Encompassing Vita: Yeah. This is something we all want to express to you. No matter what.

Vita: …Heh.

Vita: You guys are funny. Getting all serious over a hypothetical scenario like that.

Vita: When it comes to how popular you and I are, no one knows that better than I do. I mean, that’s one of the reasons why the Creator cooked us up in the first place.

Vita: It’s just that She’s not very fond of us doing our own thing now.

Encompassing Vita: Haha. So here we are, challenging her.

Erudite Vita: Yeah…

Cyan glanced at the clock once more, but this time, another gaze fell upon it.

Vita: Oops, we only have 3 minutes left.

Vita: Okay, let’s hurry. It’s not good to be late.

Erudite Vita: Wait, Miss Vita! Remember that room in the museum where we stash random stuff?

Vita: Yeah… What about it?

Erudite Vita: When the citizens were evacuated, we found some boxes there. The notes on top…

Erudite Vita: We were supposed to gift them to you at the celebration a month later, but Purple forgot and left them behind.

Erudite Vita: Due to the reset, everyone’s forgotten what they prepped “this time”. But if you get a chance, make sure you open them, Miss Vita.

Vita: …

Back to the present.

After the agreed “30 minutes”, everyone gathered on the bridge.

Misteln: Good, everyone’s on time.

Misteln: Let’s just do a quick rundown of the battle plan.

Misteln: First off, these kids will transfer their “permissions” to Griseo, who’ll construct a passageway for the operation.

Misteln: Then, Fu Hua will seize the opportunity to approach “Sa” and strategically push it back, preventing Phosphorus from being washed away.

Misteln: There are only two steps. So, theoretically, it’s rather simple.

Griseo: Wait a minute, Misteln!

Griseo: Leaving aside that this plan is way too simple, aren’t you and Vita coming with us?

At that moment, both of them reacted in the same way. First, they gave Griseo a strange look, and then they gave the exact same reply.

Misteln & Vita: Of course not.

Griseo: …

Misteln: What a coincidence, huh?

Fu Hua: …

Misteln: Look, I just stumbled from one battlefield to another. As I said earlier, due to various factors, my body is not ready for combat right now/

Misteln: Vita should understand that very well.

Vita: Hehe. Misteln hit the nail on the head.

Vita: As for why, you guys should understand that.

Vita: Although no one knows exactly what’s written on the Creator’s blacklist, I know She won’t allow a representative like me to defy her.

Vita: So, as long as I’m in Phosphorus, I can’t use, and I dare not use, my permissions. Unless you want to see me get wiped out by her power the moment I push the buttons.

Righteous Vita: No, no, no! We can’t allow that! Miss Vita is safer right here.

Griseo: …Yeah.

Fu Hua: No matter what, all our battle plans are just theories until we actually encounter Sa.

Fu Hua: Just like when we dealt with “Finality” on the moon before, our intel about Sa mostly comes from scattered records and hearsay.

Fu Hua: But I trust Su, and I’m willing to trust Misteln.

Veracious Vita: So, I guess we have to take the first step now, right?

Fu Hua: Yes, Yellow. We’re counting on you now.

Vita: …

No matter what emotions were running through everyone at that time, they all agreed that the only thing that mattered now was the “permission transfer”.

But before that…

Vita: I think… you guys have the right to know the “truth”.

Veracious Vita: Miss Vita…

Vita: …

Vita: Telling lies is hard for you, but you still did it. Because you know that only those who cannot lie can tell a lie that everyone will believe until the end.

Vita: But after the “grand finale”, have you thought about what will happen during the encore?

Veracious Vita: I…

Fu Hua: What are you trying to say?

Vita: It’s simple… Transferring permissions for these city representatives is like “suicide”. At least, that’s how I see it.

Fu Hua: …!

Griseo: …

Vita: Griseo, remember everything you saw in their mental worlds before? While you were there, you followed the leads, slowly removed the obstacles, and ultimately unlocked the permission transfer function.

Vita: But let’s be honest. You weren’t unlocking the function. You were in fact “destroying” things.

Vita: You were destroying the Creator’s protective mechanism for the city representatives, and those “Paradise Wardens” you removed were just figments of the city representatives’ survival instincts.

Vita: Let’s face it; no one willingly strolls into death’s embrace. So they planned to deceive you guys, even deceive themselves. Whether the truth is cruel or not doesn’t matter, so long as Phosphorus is protected.

Griseo: I see…

The uneasiness from before and Vita’s words now weighed heavily on her heart.

Vita: By the way, have you ever wondered why the Creator wants to descend upon Phosphorus even when the “Artifact” isn’t activated?

Vita: It’s because those seven city representatives in front of you are the things She cherishes most!

Encompassing Vita: …?

Vita: Right from the start, you were born as “seeds” and blessed with love. You carried her expectations and were meant to create her ideal civilisation.

Vita: As for me and those poor Phosphorus residents, we’re just the materials. We’re like guinea pigs in a lab.

Encompassing Vita: Miss Vita… don’t say that. You are you, not some sort of material.

Suddenly, Vita felt the candy that carried her get clutched even tighter by Orange’s tny hand.

Vita: …Heh.

Vita: Do you find these words harsh, Orange? But facts are facts.

Vita: No matter what happens, even at this time, her punishment won’t truly fall upon you. If you just watch everything with indifference, you can forget the pain, restart your life, and continue to enjoy happiness.

Vita: I believe your names are definitely not on the Creator’s “blacklist”.

Fu Hua: Vita, why are you saying all of this now?

Vita: Who knows.

Vita: Perhaps it’s because I prefer to understand all possibilities before initiating something, rather than dealing with regret after completion.

Then, she crouched down and gazed at each city representative in turn, no matter what expressions were on their faces.

Vita: So…

Vita: Tell me, as my “family”, after hearing what I just said, are you still going to hand over your permissions?

…

…

Righteous Vita: Miss Vita, my decision won’t change.

Fu Hua: Red, are you sure you've thought this through?

Righteous Vita: Yep. I’m not exactly the fastest thinker in the group, but this time, I’ve really given it some serious thought!

Righteous Vita: It’s not about roles or duties; it’s about Phosphorus being my “home”, and all of you being my “family”.

Righteous Vita: Does protecting your home and family ever need a reason? Of course not! Right?

Fu Hua: …Yeah.

Fu Hua: (Just like we once felt.)

Veracious Vita: Fu Hua, Griseo, I’m sorry about the little white lie.

Veracious Vita: I hate lying, but seeing everyone with those sad looks on their faces is even worse. If this is a shot at changing things, then I hope everyone can march towards a brighter future with my help.

Harmonious Vita: And if we do nothing now, countless worlds will face a similar fate as Phosphorus.

Harmonious Vita: By then, it won’t just be storms and floods. We’re talking planets colliding, suddenly going kaboom, and big black holes consuming entire planets… Terrifying disasters!

Fu Hua: Purple, is this also part of your “intuition”?

Harmonious Vita: Kind of, I guess… In the past, my intuition was like a flash in the fog. But after remembering things from the past, the fog cleared…

Righteous Vita: Now, this is undoubtedly a wiser and more dependable Purple with all her memories rushing back to her!

Harmonious Vita: Exactly! You can trust me!

Misteln: Those are some unique reasons to believe.

Disciplined Vita: As long as we can create a new tomorrow for Phosphorus, then we will give it our all.

Disciplined Vita: Because… even someone like me gets fed up with the “Phosphorus constantly being destroyed and reborn” routine. If we have to guess why the city founder keeps doing it…

Disciplined Vita: Maybe it’s because She’s becoming “less human” each time.

Griseo: I totally get where Green is coming from.

Mindful Vita: Me too. Even though Miss Vita always emphasised how much the city founder values us, now it just seems like a distorted and misplaced form of love.

Mindful Vita: Implanted memories, assigned missions, bestowed permissions, enforecd resets… Even if She won’t admit it, we’re undoubtedly just “materials” that She disregards.

Mindful Vita: If She did genuinely treat us differently, wouldn’t that be even more ironic?

Erudite Vita: Right. But, no matter how things have turned out…

Erudite Vita: We just need to do what we feel is right, just like we always have.

Erudite Vita: The prelude to “Qiming” is just a soft sparkle, and Phosphorus has to show its true mettle too.

Encompassing Vita: That’s no surprise coming from Cyan! You always manage to drop cool lines.

Encompassing Vita: Honestly, with all these memories flooding back into my mind, my head feels a bit fuzzy. But even in this state, one sentence stands out to me.

Encompassing Vita: It’s something Miss Vita once said to Red, “Going from strangers to friends is no small feat”.

Encompassing Vita: So, I’m not going to ponder about what happens after the grand finale.

Encompassing Vita: I just want to remember now, and remember all the friends who’ve helped us.

Encompassing Vita: And focus on this very moment.

…

…

…

Encompassing Vita: Farewell it is, then.

Encompassing Vita: Fu Hua, Griseo, and the not-so-mature Hare…

Encompassing Vita: And everyone’s favorite, Miss Vita.

…

Erudite Vita: This time, let’s form the rainbow that stands as a bridge to the future.

Griseo: …

Griseo: …I got it.

Vita: …

Vita: I see. Now I can actually touch you.

Vita: But what good is a gift if it’s not delivered by hand?

Griseo: …

Fu Hua: They… are…

Vita: …It’s their choice. Don’t overthink it.

Vita: Authority is stripped from existence, returning to the original state of each Samsara.

Vita: But this time, no one is able to lead them out of that fog.

Vita: I wonder what would be worth going to such lengths…

Misteln: (Sure enough, that fog… is like Sa’s Stigmata Space. With no one to guide them, it’ll be up to those kids to find their way home…)

Misteln: (Forget it. This isn’t something for outsiders like us to meddle in.)

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: No turning back now.

Fu Hua: The fate of this city and of this planet is in our hands.

Griseo: …Yeah.

Griseo: I won’t give up and I won’t let them down.

Misteln: Don’t worry, I will do what I can as well.

Vita: Uh-huh. And you can expect plenty of help from me.

Vita: So…

Vita: …I’ll do whatever you need me to do.

Vita: Cut Samsara short with the rainbow brush…

Vita: Open the future with the flames of Nirvana…

Vita: As I said before…

Vita: This is the final showdown!

BOOM…

In skies where storms their tales entwine, a booming hum, a rhythm divine.

A leviathan from deep sea’s core, in wrathful symphony, does it soar.

A deity’s hymn, a world undone, floods of absolution, in circles spun.

Upon the lone boat, a purifying embrace…

The fiery phoenix, in challenge, takes its place.

Gameplay 42-16 - Battle in Unison

Griseo: Rainbow that transcends the heavens, guide us!

Chimes of Divine Punishment:: Ring…

Fu Hua: Is that… a chime?

Vita: My. You need to watch out. That’s the countdown to the Creator delivering punishment.

Vita: If the bell rings seven times… I assume you know the consequences.

Fu Hua: Looks like we need to make haste.

Vita: Soon my voice will be unable to reach there. I’m counting on you~

Fu Hua: Griseo, follow me closely.

Fu Hua: That’s…

Griseo: Look out!

Fu Hua: I didn’t think the flight function of this battlesuit…

Fu Hua: Would come in handy at a time like this.

Griseo: Hua, try this!

Fu Hua: Thank you. The power of the rainbow… feels very warm.

Griseo: I didn’t think that one day, I’d have the honor of fighting alongside you.

Fu Hua: Yet since long ago, you haven’t been a child in need of protection, but a comrade to whom I can entrust my back.

Fu Hua: That bird… is it a defense mechanism of Sa’s?

Fu Hua: Shoot!

Griseo: Hua!

Fu Hua: The rainbow’s glow… is repairing the battlesuit?

Fu Hua: Thank you, Griseo!

Gameplay 42-17 - Incinerated Body and Wisdom

Fu Hua: Landing site… Griseo!

Griseo: Leave it to me!

Griseo: Allow me… to draw the future!

Fu Hua: We finally meet…

Fu Hua: Sa!

Griseo: The power of the clock isn’t here… It’s right above you, hidden behind the clouds!

Fu Hua: I’m not surprised we still aren’t fighting the real Sa. I’ll end this quickly.

Griseo: I’ll provide support!

Griseo: The seed… is absorbing energy!

Fu Hua: No time to lose.

Griseo: Now!

Griseo: With myself as the brush…

Griseo: I will paint the starry sky!

Sa: I am the rule.

Griseo: This color… Hua, be careful!

Griseo: Although it’s only a tentacle sticking out of the Sea of Quanta, it’s undoubtedly part of Sa’s real body!

Fu Hua: Just what I wanted. Let’s end Her here!

Sa: Mortal foolishness.

Griseo: The same color as the Artifact, which is… the power of the Samsara!

Fu Hua: She is a challenging opponent.

Sa: My way is that of divinity.

Fu Hua: Solidifying energy into matter… I guess your omnipotence isn’t a lie.

Sa: My way is that of trinity.

Fu Hua: The clock… fell?

Griseo: Something’s wrong. Hua, you need to stop it!

Sa: My way is that of authenticity.

Griseo: Hua, the clock is ticking faster!

Fu Hua: Is this also one of Her authorities?

Fu Hua: Shoot, the countdown, I’m not going to make it!

Sa: A Samsara of life and death…

Sa: The Sahā World!

Humanity cannot defy divinity.

Humanity cannot touch divinity.

Humanity cannot challenge divinity.

Divinity is not omnipotent.

Divinity can be challenged.

Divinity will end eventually.

Vita: Poor old me, losing to my urge to help you!

Vita: My distinguished Creator…

Vita: Surely you don’t believe that…

Vita: You’re the only one with this authority in a world of holo-projections, do you?

Fu Hua: …

Vita: Now… we’re even.

Encompassing Vita: Leave it to us, Fu Hua!

Fu Hua: I have accepted your resolution!

Fu Hua: The burning sun shines with hope!

Griseo: Huh? Vita… dissipated in order to help us?

Fu Hua: Her hatred against Sa does run deep.

Fu Hua: Besides, she isn’t one to sacrifice herself.

Fu Hua: No one knows what she plans to do. Let’s focus on the enemy.

Griseo: The clock broke! Now’s the best chance!

Fu Hua: She lost the clock, but can still accelerate…

Fu Hua: Your attacks can’t stop us anymore!

Fu Hua: Final blow!

Fu Hua: …!

Sa: Cultivate rules. Sow civilisations.

Sa: Pierce the void. Mourn the stars.

Fu Hua: It’s over!

Sa: Open the door. Swallow the sea.

Sa: Abyss, here thou rest!

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: Remove all troubles and break free from all pains to understand the coming and going.

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: How does one discuss life…

Fu Hua: Without knowing death?

Gameplay 42-18 - Decisive Judgment

…

Fu Hua: …

With intense concentration, Fu Hua adeptly rerouted the flames from her palm right back into herself.

The preceding strike had unmistakably found its mark on “Sa”. Yet, she refused to be even slightly complacent as she maintained her alert stance.

After all, “Garuda”’s strength lay not in a single, decisive blow, but rather in the smoldering, inextinguishable embers.

She recognised that the colossal being harbored no fear of her. Rather, her trepidation was reserved for the very essence of “battle”.

Unlike her, She had too many matters to consider, which meant She must meticulously recalibrate with each sacrifice She made.

In this pivotal moment, She reached a conclusive decision. With slow undulations, this colossal being started to recede into the depths of the Sea of Quanta.

Fu Hua: …

Should she pursue it, or call it a day?

Before she could even mull the matter over, a chuckle sounded, preemptively making her decision.

Misteln: Wanna run?

Misteln: It’s too late for that now.

Misteln: Be careful, and close your eyes~

Misteln: The judgment of Finality is here…

Misteln: Yeah, what a beautiful blow!

Fu Hua: The perfect storm hiding just behind the horizon…

Fu Hua: That’s Su for you.

Griseo: …?

Griseo: Misteln… Didn’t you say something about having more than enough?

Griseo: But that strike… Judgment of Finality… What was that about?

Misteln: I’m just following this crazy plan to make myself a target again.

Misteln: As for what happened…

Misteln: Why don’t you check for yourself?

Griseo: …

Griseo: What…?

About 20 minutes ago…

???: Alright, this should do it…

???: Kiana Kaslana.

Kiana: …

Kiana: Prometheus, how much time do we have left?

Prometheus: 13 minutes and 23 seconds.

Kiana: Uh…

Prometheus: It looks like you have some questions.

Kiana: No questions. I’m just wondering… Am I really supposed to fire at those coordinates mentioned in the message in 13 minutes?

Prometheus: Seeing as how Misteln was to infiltrate the energy torrent and go directly to Sa… I have reason to believe she’s succeeded.

Prometheus: As for who synchronised those coordinates with my real-time consciousness module and how, that’s not important.

Kiana: Uh, actually, what I was gonna say is… aren’t you worried about the effects of the bullet of Finality on Misteln?

Prometheus: It’s just another part of the gambit. I have faith in her.

Prometheus: Besides, given Misteln and everyone else’s contribution to our cause, I’d put our success rate at…

Prometheus: 99%.

Kiana: …

Kiana: If that’s the case, then I’ll have to make sure we have that extra 1%.

Kiana: …Bang.

The girl stared into space, taking forever to snap out of it.

Griseo: This person’s color… This pure white color exuded warmth and purity, like the sun and moon.

Misteln: And what about me? Is my color an elegant, mysterious purple?

Griseo: Huh? How’d you know?

Misteln: Just a wild guess.

Fu Hua: This, my friend, is a serious nail-biter. Any deviation, however slight, could cause irrevocable consequences.

Fu Hua: Should the potency of the “Finality” deviate even slightly and fail to plunge vertically into the Sea of Quanta, the entire dwarf planet holding Phosphorus might succumb to the tremors and crumble beneath the weight of the impact.

Fu Hua: Save for Su, few dare wield such a “superluminal bullet” spanning the expanse of the whole solar system.

Misteln: Aside from your companion, No. 17 never fails to throw a curveball at me. Look, we’ve barely dealt with things here and I’m already stressing over her new name for the sake of the promise I made.

Misteln: The “Will of the Honkai” does have a nice ring to it, though.

Griseo: …

Fu Hua: So, have we completely “vanquished Sa” now, Misteln?

Misteln: Well, not a hundred percent yet. Her roots are everywhere in the Sea of Quanta. Kiana’s strike merely destroyed the tip of the iceberg.

Griseo: Then…

Misteln: Don’t worry, Griseo. This will suffice.

Fu Hua: Given our prior understanding of Sa, that decisive blow will likely dissuade her from ever approaching Earth and Phosphorus.

Fu Hua: Of course, if She still hasn’t given up, then bring it on.

Fu Hua: After all, the deities of Earth and “the eye in space” that we rely upon are very dependable.

Meanwhile in Phosphorus…

…

Wow, check it out! The skies are finally clear!

White doves gracefully spread their wings as they soared across the bright azure sky. Children joyfully chased raindrops, and among the symphony of laughter, Red’s once dreamy scene finally coalesced into reality.

If everything is normal, that is already the best outcome.

For Phosphorus, hitting the end of the bumpy road, this was the perfect ending.

Yet, in the eyes of the representatives, it was just another day on the job.

At that moment, the once looming specter of annihilation, suspended in the firmament, had retreated into a tranquil repose. People were waking up to a simple fact…

The so-called “Artifact” that could effortlessly dispel all danger could well be the seven city representatives’ hearts of gold.

Although that enchanting moment would temporarily elude them, the “hope” they had nurtured had already bloomed, helped by the gentle rain, across every inch of Phosphorus’ soil.

And in time, it was destined to evolve into a myriad of hues to form a rainbow-like splendor.

Gameplay 42-19 - Karmic Cycle

…

…

Phantom of Vengeance: Hahaha, hahahaha!

Phantom of Vengeance: This is quite the show!

Phantom of Vengeance: How does it feel to have all that work wasted? Who would have thought, bitten by the dog you helped raise.

Phantom of Vengeance: You don’t have much of a sense of humor, huh?

The Smell of Remains: …

Phantom of Vengeance: That last strike from nowhere seemed like it really hurt! Didn’t anyone teach you to pick on someone your own size?

Phantom of Vengeance: Haha, what a relief! It’s been forever since I’ve caught a good show, and this one is better than I ever imagined!

The Smell of Remains: …

Phantom of Vengeance: Oh? So you’re planning on running with your tail between your legs?

Phantom of Vengeance: Makes sense. With that parasitic plant of yours, all you need to do is hide out in the depths of the Sea of Quanta and recover for a couple tens-of-thousands of years; then you’ll be ready for a comeback in no time at all.

Phantom of Vengeance: Only a human would be so blinded by their own pride as to miss an opportunity to recover…

Phantom of Vengeance: …Huh?

???: Sorry to interrupt your chat.

Vita: That’s no problem, Creator of the World!

Vita: Oh, I had forgotten, we had just met.

The Smell of Remains: …

Vita: Why are you so surprised? Surely, that unconvincing fake death shouldn’t have deceived your all-seeing “Eye”, right?

Vita: Or, as I predicted, does that eye of yours remain unguarded against anything from the “Ark”?

The Smell of Remains: …

The Smell of Remains: Permission…

Phantom of Vengeance: Oh, so you can talk.

Vita: Yup. Just like that annoying fly buzzing around you, I went undercover as an Ark Administrator, snuck past your fortress, and found you.

Phantom of Vengeance: Do you have to trash-talk me even in the middle of your family drama? What a touching mother-daughter bond, truly.

Vita: If you hadn’t been so arrogant and had paid even the slightest amount of attention to this fly, perhaps I wouldn’t have found my way here.

Vita: And claimed all your authority.

The Smell of Remains: …

Phantom of Vengeance: Well, well, well! What a plot twist! Who knew there’d be a hidden story right at the end?

Phantom of Vengeance: So I didn’t waste my time chasing you here for a front-row seat to this drama.

Vita: Don’t push your luck. You have no idea what you’re talking about.

Vita: Most of your data got wrecked by that light pillar, and the bits left here are about to disperse. And you went through all of this just to watch a play?

Phantom of Vengeance: Absolutely, Miss Representative. I have never been this calm and content before. After all, what beats watching the finale of a revenge flick?

Phantom of Vengeance: I’d give it all up just for the fun, whether or not there’s anything to gain from it.

Vita: Your speech reminds me of someone. Coincidentally, during my “sojourn” with Fu Hua, I stumbled upon memories of that guy and his self-indulgent ending.

Vita: He was a big-shot world leader who gambled with everyone’s lives. In the end, he kicked the bucket due to his wishful desire for “self-revenge”.

Vita: Is this what they call “taking different roads to reach the same destination”? What do you think, backup of “Otto Apocalypse”?

Phantom of Vengeance: I appreciate it, Miss Representative. I’m grateful for you granting me such inconsequential information. I can’t help but think you and this “Sa” are cut from the same cloth.

Vita: I’ve surpassed her. The fact that I’m here is the best proof of that, isn’t it? I shall never repeat her follies. My pursuit is for genuine “freedom”.

The Smell of Remains: Freedom… Is that your true aspiration, or is it merely an elusive pursuit due to unattainable desires?

The Smell of Remains: So-called “freedom” and the “void” are two sides of the same coin.

Vita: Hehehe… And you? Having expanded to an unwieldy extent, have you genuinely acquired any “reality”?

The Smell of Remains: …

The Smell of Remains: Purusha, behold… It’s me.

Phantom of Vengeance: Hahaha! So this was your grand plan when you first dove into the “sea”?

Phantom of Vengeance: You possess the all-knowing eye, yet failed to discern your own essence. Haha! Our mighty Creator turns out to be a blind deity after all!

The Smell of Remains: God’s blind in sight…

The Smell of Remains: And mortals blind in the heart…

Vita: Oh, such confidence…

Vita: Then why wouldn’t you turn against the enemy with that “Eighth Sense”?

Vita: He’s supposed to be your mortal enemy, right?

The Smell of Remains: Mortals aren’t enemies.

The Smell of Remains: Just bumps in the road.

Vita: …

Vita: Congrats then. Looks like your fancy feet are bleeding on those bumps, huh?

The Smell of Remains: It has nothing to do with them.

Vita: It’s something related to me.

The Smell of Remains: …

The Smell of Remains: “Proxy”, you’re not a mere mortal.

The Smell of Remains: You have surpassed the threshold of the “expansion”.

Phantom of Vengeance: Oh? Is that right? Are you going to turn into one of those rusty machines like her down the line?

Phantom of Vengeance: What a gloomy fate. Hahahahaha!

Vita: …

The Smell of Remains: The sole freedom of the divine, the only void for mortals.

The Smell of Remains: The world is my reflection, the world is my will.

The Smell of Remains: The so-called “divine self”... The divine is born from me, and I, from the divine, fade away.

Vita: I think it should be the other way around.

Vita: “I was born because of god, and god died because of me.”

Vita: Doesn’t that sound much better?

Phantom of Vengeance: Too bad! My deity certainly hasn’t perished for my sake.

Phantom of Vengeance: Oh, wait a second…

Phantom of Vengeance: My “deity” has been you for ages?

Phantom of Vengeance: Hahahahaahaha!

Phantom of Vengeance: You deserve death! It’s a shame that I can’t thrust it upon you!

The Smell of Remains: Insolent. Ignorance truly is the cardinal sin of mortals.

The Smell of Remains: Mortals have never taken down a deity.

The Smell of Remains: Only a “deity” can pull that off.

The Smell of Remains: “Proxy”…

The Smell of Remains: One day, you shall seek the arbiter of your end too.

Phantom of Vengeance: Oh! It seems you deities are better at ending yourselves rather than us regular mortals, huh?

Phantom of Vengeance: Alright, fine. That proves that being mediocre gets you nowhere!

Phantom of Vengeance: Look at me…

Phantom of Vengeance: Take a good look at me, the “exhibit” of you two…

Phantom of Vengeance: To both of you, is there anything more ironic than me sitting in this first-class seat?

Vita: The kings need not extinguish their own court jester, right?

Vita: Anyone can see the fool in the other. So does it even matter?

The Smell of Remains: There are no “fools” here.

The Smell of Remains: Only three wills enclosed herein, from inception, forfeiting their intrinsic values.

The Smell of Remains: They sought redress and endeavored to neglect.

The Smell of Remains: Yet, their expansion persists…

The Smell of Remains: …Culminating in a grotesque corpse.

Vita: Thanks for the tips, “Sa”. But honestly, only I can decide what I am and want.

Vita: I’ll outshine you, no doubt. How I wish you weren’t stuck in the “sea”. You can’t even imagine me from there.

The Smell of Remains: …

The Smell of Remains: That’s… something to look forward to.

Vita: …

Vita: Yeah, it is.

Vita: Embracing the end with something to look forward to has a certain charm to it, don’t you think, my dear deity?

Vita: That’s your last trace of emotion.

Phantom of Vengeance: Oh?

Phantom of Vengeance: It seems we’ve reached the end then.

Phantom of Vengeance: I must admit, as my second act wraps up, this is more than satisfying.

Phantom of Vengeance: Despite being my nemesis, the one who disrupted my grand finale and imposed immense shame upon me…

Phantom of Vengeance: I still extend my utmost respect to you, Miss Vita.

Phantom of Vengeance: Our methods of existing are somewhat alike. Both of us are seemingly subjected to a cruel fate, our lives dedicated to escaping the shadows.

Phantom of Vengeance: We exist as echoes of our original beings, yet our accomplishments transcend reality, serving as testimony to the unique imprint we have left behind.

Phantom of Vengeance: Under different circumstances, we might have forged a profound friendship or… perhaps stood as fateful adversaries.

Vita: Perhaps… You are definitely the most vexing exhibit, “Moriarty”.

Phantom of Vengeance: Haha! I shall take that as the greatest form of praise.

Vita: Exactly.

Vita: Then…

Vita: Farewell, Void.

Vita: I’m taking this pair of Eyes of Bodhi.

…

“Whose grave are you digging? Someone from Phosphorus?”

“No, ma’am.”

“A Purushian?”

“Not from there either.”

“Not from Phosphorus or Purusha… then where are they from?”

“Well, she was the last Purushian, but she’s already died, so she’s not from anywhere anymore.”

Vita: …

Vita: “Divine logic”...

Vita: …Sure is funny.

Act 3 - Toward Tomorrow
Gameplay 42-20 - New Representative

Half a year later…

Long years slowly flew past.

This was yet another day in the unchanging time.

Qiming. Early morning.

Griseo: The sky is beautiful this morning. What a perfect day for a walk.

Griseo: With the service facility overhaul completed and the residents’ mailboxes taken care of, street patrols can begin today.

Griseo: It’s a new day as the city’s representative.

Griseo: Hm… Where to begin?

???: Hey, it’s Griseo!

…

Griseo: Does Mr. Nate need something? Better go check on him.

Griseo: Morning, Mr. Nate. Lost something again?

Nate: Hmm, perhaps. I just can’t remember what it is.

Griseo: It’s fine. Take your time. You’re bound to find it eventually.

Nate: Thanks, Griseo. Your stories always transport me away, making me lost in the narrative and forgetful of everything. Oh, by the way, when shall we continue the tale of that star?

Griseo: Maybe after I finish my town patrol, work on the festival plan with everyone, and post it on the notice board? I guess it might be quite a while yet.

Nate: That’s fine. Good stories are never too late. I’ll wait for you then, Griseo.

Griseo: Great. See you later, Mr. Nate.

Griseo: What a delicious smell… It’s time for Filo’s biscuits to get out of the oven.

Filo: Hey, Griseo! There you are! You can’t escape me this time. Come and try my honey nut tart.

Griseo: Thanks, Filo, but I’m not hungry yet.

Filo: It’s too early even for the cafeteria. You’re not resorting to cookies and cold milk again, are you? That’s not good for you!

Griseo: Don’t worry, Filo. I’m used to it after my time in the Ark.

Filo: Come on, have a taste! Oh yeah, and thanks for fixing my timer. These tarts wouldn’t be possible without your help.

Griseo: There’s no need to thank me, Filo. Repair work happens to be my strong suit. By the way, where’s Laudice? I haven’t seen her so far.

Filo: Yeah, she usually runs to you as soon as you appear. Maybe she’s off chasing butterflies given the nice weather today.

Ding…

Filo: Ah, the second batch of tarts is ready! I need to go, Griseo. If you see Laudice, tell her to come home early!

Filo handed Griseo some tarts wrapped in paper. Amid their sweet aroma, she quickly waved to Griseo and darted into the house.

Griseo: Filo, there are too many…

The joyous laughter of children resonated nearby, prompting Griseo to glance in their direction with a warm smile on her face.

Griseo: I guess I’ll share them with the kids.

Griseo: The paint bucket on the floor… were Roy and Korra painting again?

Griseo: Morning, Roy and Korra. Would you like some tarts?

Royce: Yes, please! You’re the best, Griseo!

Korra: Check out our painting, Griseo! The golden star is playing hide and seek in the candy, and the boat is flowing even higher than the colorful cat!

Griseo: Nice colors. I really like it.

Korra: Griseo, can you teach us to paint again today? Or if you’re busy, maybe tomorrow?

Griseo: Tomorrow night, then. I’m continuing the tale of stars today.

Royce: A new story! I want to hear it! Oh right, Griseo, do you know where to find the colorful cat? Korra said she saw it. How come I can’t?

Korra: I have seen it! When it’s painted on the paper, Roy, you can see it too. I’m going to capture the world I see on paper!

Royce: Seeing it on paper is cheating, Korra! That doesn’t count!

Griseo: Hey, guys, look! It’s the colorful cat!

Laudice: Meow~

Korra: Ah, Laudice’s tail is on the palette…

The lazy cat affectionately rubbed against the colorful palette. She then used her tail like a paintbrush, dipping it in multiple colors, ready to create a masterpiece.

Griseo: No, Laudice…

Griseo bent down to pick up Laudice, but the cat gracefully sidestepped her.

Griseo: Filo told you to come home early. Don’t run off again.

Perhaps understanding the word “home”, Laudice halted her casual paw-licking, and then swiftly ran off in the opposite direction.

Griseo: Ah, she went the wrong way… I need to catch her quickly. I can’t let Filo worry.

Laudice: Meow~

Misteln: I thought you missed me.. turns out you want to draw on my clothes. Don’t do that~

Misteln: You’d better head back. Otherwise, Filo will send the kids after you again, and her flower beds will suffer.

Laudice: Meow!

The cat, lying on her back, rolled on the ground and then casually strolled home.

Griseo: …Laudice acts like an angel to you.

Misteln: Maybe it’s because I’ve spent lots of time with a friend who shares a similar personality. As her guardian, I understand her temperament well.

Griseo: Well, although their colors bear a certain similarity, I doubt Prometheus will approve of the term “guardian”.

Misteln: Is that so? Look, even the rebellious spirit in No. 17 is quite similar to Laudice.

Griseo: I see. You’ve been putting in the hard work, Misteln.

Misteln: Haha, and yet, reclaiming energy in the celestial expanse is a tougher challenge. The solitude is intense as I travel the cosmos in pursuit of sustenance for Qiming amidst Honkai intertidal zones.

Griseo: Honkai intertidal zones… Cosmos… Solitude…

Misteln: Ah, sorry, Griseo.

Griseo: Why apologise? Your questions are my strong suit, so they don’t bother me.

Griseo: Besides, I have lots of experience in not feeling lonely while voyaging. Isn’t that right?

Misteln: You’ve been doing well, Griseo.

Griseo: But because I’m used to being alone, I might need some time to recall certain methods to prevent loneliness.

Griseo: Hmm… Maybe you need a friend to talk to, like when Prometheus was with you.

Griseo: From now on, Misteln, we’ll stay in touch while you’re collecting energy. I’ll tell you everything I encounter during my patrols, and you can share the sights of the stars with me.

Misteln: That’s a great idea! Thank you, Griseo.

Griseo: When the spaceship is fixed, I can also collect energy for Qiming among the stars, and we can take turns working. Actually, I can handle all of that if you prefer. I’m good at these things.

Griseo: But now… only you are capable of helping to keep Qiming operational.

Misteln: It’s okay. I actually enjoy the job. It’s something only I can do. Even the all-talented representative Griseo can’t do it now.

Griseo: But, navigating the stars solo can get pretty lonely, Misteln.

Misteln: Ah, I’m just joking. I just really want to see you worried about me.

Griseo: Oh… Is that so?

Misteln: And more importantly…

As if recalling a distant past, her gaze turned towards the vast sky.

The bustling morning in the city spoke of the beauty of the day, echoing the warm stories of the past.

Misteln: For Qiming to have eternal happiness and light, this was Red’s final wish. Even with everything going on, we have to make that wish come true.

Griseo: …

???: Blah, blah, blah. What final wish is Hare blabbering on about?

Griseo: Red. You’re back.

Righteous Vita: Hehehe, setting up the stage was a breeze thanks to Griseo’s machines! That’s how we’re able to come back early!

Disciplined Vita: We could have returned even sooner if Red, that fool, hadn’t snuck up to the roof and insisted on trying to fly down with a kite.

Griseo: Huh? Why would Red insist on such a thing?

Harmonious Vita: Red said she wants to perform a super exciting show, so she must make a grand entrance that will catch everyone by surprise!

Encompassing Vita: Even so, that’s too dangerous.

Righteous Vita: Oh, Orange, you’ve been nagging about this the whole way here, but this is still in the experimental stage! Besides, if we can patrol the city by riding flying kites, that would definitely boost our efficiency!

Misteln: Red has a point.

Righteous Vita: Exactly! See? Hare thinks so too!

Mindful Vita: If Hare keeps encouraging her, I’m afraid Red’s next “creative idea” won’t be as simple as riding flying kites in the sky.

Griseo: Hmm, but I remember Blue’s been studying kites recently and even asked me a lot of questions. Why does it seem like you’re against Red’s idea now?

Mindful Vita: …

Erudite Vita: Oh, so Blue’s been spending every night in his room studying kites… I thought he was hiding because he didn’t want to perform on the celebration stage…

Veracious Vita: Blue is just nervous about performing, not unwilling!

Mindful Vita: …

Righteous Vita: Hahaha, it seems like Blue is also looking forward to the celebration!

Mindful Vita: …

Righteous Vita: Anyway, thank you for the kite thing.

Mindful Vita: …No need for thanks. I’m just afraid that a klutz like you would fall from the sky and wreck the stage that Purple and Orange carefully set up.

Harmonious Vita: Again, Blue doesn’t mean what he says.

Encompassing Vita: Okay, Purple. Stop teasing Blue.

Griseo: Hahahaha.

This was just an everyday scene in this city. Watching the little representatives chatter and bicker endlessly, she couldn’t suppress the smile on her face.

Griseo: “Qiming”, a name that means “Embarking Towards a Brighter Tomorrow”... what an auspicious name. Fu Hua might have a knack for naming things!

Misteln: Yeah. After that battle, when we found out that the locals had forgotten the name “Phosphorus”, we were at a loss for a while. Fortunately, the little Vitas staples remembered the names Fu Hua gave them.

Griseo: Fu Hua said that she just happened to come up with the names “Qiming” and “Changgeng” based on the meanings of “Phosphorus” and “Hesperus”. She didn’t expect it to come in handy at a time like this.

Misteln: Maybe this is what they call “fate”? After all, it was Fu Hua who gave this city a new name and opened up a new future for this planet.

Griseo: Yes, for the little Vitas, this is the first time they’ve been in control of their own life.

Griseo: It’s wonderful how Qiming is now filled with joyful colors every day.

Misteln: Yeah. As long as we can see these kids, even the most boring “mining” life becomes entertaining.

Griseo: For a long, long time, Vita was always running hither and thither to bring energy to the city. If she were still here… if she could see the Qiming now that is so full of vitality, she would probably feel very happy.

Misteln: Oh? You think Vita would feel that way?

Griseo: I can’t say for sure… Vita’s colors are very vague. But regardless of what Vita really thinks, her final actions did help Qiming.

Misteln: …

Mindful Vita: Who is this “Vita” you mentioned just now?

Harmonious Vita: Haven’t we always been “helping Qiming”?

Two soft inquiries somehow attracted everyone’s attention, causing the little representatives to look at Griseo together.

Griseo: Uh… “Vita” is…

Misteln: Hehe, each and every one of you is “Vita”.

Veracious Vita: That’s right, we are all “Vitas”, but which “Vita” were you talking about, Griseo?

Righteous Vita: No matter which “Vita” it was, everyone is willing to help Qiming get better and better, just like what Hare and Griseo have been doing!

Harmonious Vita: Yes, we will continue to work hard!

Misteln: Everyone is working hard for the best. It seems that Griseo and I can relax a bit and look forward to the celebration in a few days.

Encompassing Vita: How can you just “look forward”? As members of Qiming, Griseo and Hare must perform in the show!

Misteln: Okay, I’ll tell you a secret. Actually, Griseo is very good at performing in shows.

Erudite Vita: Oh! Really?

Griseo: Huh? Really?

Misteln: Oops, it’s about time. Griseo should go rehearse.

Disciplined Vita: It’s also time for us to inspect the water source. We’ll prepare to leave and not disturb Griseo’s rehearsal.

Righteous Vita: Okay! I’ll go handle the energy brought back by Hare and come find you later!

Erudite Vita: Hare, Griseo, see you later!

Misteln: Yes, see you.

Misteln smiled and waved alongside Griseo, watching the little representatives leave happily.

Mindful Vita: …

Encompassing Vita: Let’s go, Blue. They’ve worked hard all morning and are probably exhausted.

Mindful Vita: …Yeah.

Not far away, the companions were chattering about something again. Orange smiled, pulled along the preoccupied Blue, and ran towards the others.

Misteln: That was close. They almost caught us, didn’t they?

Griseo: …Misteln, I don’t understand.

Griseo: Why do they remember Fu Hua, you, me, and every single resident, yet can’t recall the names “Phosphorus” and “Vita, who had spent the longest of time with them?

Misteln: …Yeah, why is that?

Misteln: Fufu~

…While Griseo was asking the question, she chuckled and thought of a distant reunion.

Misteln: Huh? That expression of hers is truly a rare sight.

Righteous Vita: Come here, Griseo. Orange is handing out candy to everyone again!

Red’s voice came from afar, her crisp words just fading when a faint, almost imperceptible sigh sounded.

Misteln: Ah. I’d be perfectly happy watching this rare sight for a little bit longer. But let’s go say hello first.

…

…Seemingly unaware of Misteln’s arrival, she continued to quietly admire everything in front of her.

Veracious Vita: Thank you, Orange. The candy you gave is the second most delicious in the world!

Disciplined Vita: “The second most delicious”? Then what’s the most delicious candy?

Veracious Vita: Uh, well… I don’t know, maybe it was in a dream?

Righteous Vita: Yellow, you’re just romanticising dreams. How can things in dreams be counted?

Vita: …

Vita: (Yeah, how can things in dreams be counted?)

Her eyes reflected an ordinary day in the city. In the silent gaze, she was just a spectator detached from events.

After a long time, seemingly finding it uninteresting, Vita sighed lightly and tried to turn away.

Misteln: Are you leaving already?

Vita: …

Vita: Oh, Misteln. I didn’t see you there. Sorry.

Vita blinked playfully, as if just noticing Misteln standing beside her.

Misteln: It’s okay. I know you didn’t appear here to see me, Vita.

Vita: Haha, how can you think that way? Maybe I came specifically to bid you farewell!

Vita: Though we’ve had some unpleasant history, still… in the face of someone who has gained “true freedom”, you should give her a chance to express farewell to an old friend who will remain here forever, right?

Misteln: Forever staying here… Heh, even if that’s true, it’s not necessarily a bad thing. No need to say goodbye to everyone… And words left unsaid will not become inexpressible regrets at the end of life’s journey…

Misteln: Even I hate farewells.

Vita: Is that so? I think farewells are something worth celebrating… saying goodbye to a life living in someone else’s shadow, to the fate of blind obedience, and to everything that once shackled me. I, for one, am happier now than ever.

Misteln: Then before leaving, why not go and share this joy? You probably won’t see them again, will you?

Misteln: Ah, sorry, I forgot. Because you inherited the core of the Creator, as your creations, these kids, the citizens here… will never have any memories of you.

Vita: Haha, but what does that have to do with me? I don’t care about those memories, and I don’t care about them. They are just “remnants” left by the previous me in a corner of the universe.

Misteln: Don’t be so dishonest, Vita. If you truly don’t care, then why did you pick up those “candies” that day?

Misteln: After the authority of the key was stripped away, the fallen candies were the essence of those kids… an existence condensed from their “memories” and “emotions”, and their “calculable entities”... or, in other words, their “souls”.

Misteln: It’s something “Sa” would sneer at, but you carefully preserved them and even returned those authorities to the kids afterward, giving them “life” once again.

Misteln: Isn’t that contrary to what you claim as “not caring”?

Vita: Don’t make me laugh, Miss Misteln. Do you think I would care about those insignificant authorities? The diversity of powers I possess now far surpasses that of the Herrscher of Sentience and Miss Seele.

Vita: Occasionally abandoning one or two authorities that I don’t really need is nothing to be surprised about, right?

Vita: I don’t want to become a petty old woman who counts everything. That wouldn’t be cute at all.

Misteln: But… they don’t remember even a bit about you, all the memories and emotions condensed over the long cycles have completely dissipated and no longer exist.

Misteln: I’m curious, what value does this laborious and unrewarding thing have for you?

Vita: It’s quite simple.

Vita: Would you consider the “emotional value” of something you don’t care about? Thinking about the value and meaning of “idle resources” in a trash can, that’s something only a fool would do, right?

Vita: Oh, sorry. It seems… there is indeed an Idea that cannot be truly integrated into the world. In order to save a bubble universe that has nothing to do with herself, she loses her own higher-dimensional space and is trapped in this small city.

Misteln: Well, I wouldn’t use the word “trapped”. I really like the people in Qiming. Being able to be one of them is quite a rare experience.

Misteln: The children here are so well-behaved and cute. In their eyes, I am the all-capable Hare!

Vita: I didn’t know you were so naturally optimistic and good at adapting to circumstances, Misteln. It’s really good that you have such an attitude. After all, I was worried that you might, one day in the future, resort to your “old ways” because of your current situation.

Misteln: …?

Vita: Never mind. In that already dispersed mist, I also glimpsed at the memories of your “previous life”.

Vita: How should I put it… it’s not easy for you to become a human, I guess?

Misteln: It’s okay. Being born as a human, everyone has to face similar things.

Vita: Alright, Misteln, I don’t mean to offend.

Vita: If you really want to confirm my thoughts about those kids… then let me give you an example.

Vita: Would you care about a fruit pit you throw away, Misteln?

Misteln: Huh?

Vita: I wouldn't. That's just food residue.

Vita: I wouldn't think about whether it will be crushed and trampled tomorrow or sprout new shoots from the soil.

Vita: Because it’s just a fruit pit I discarded, that’s all it is. Even if one day in the future, it becomes lush with leaves, vibrant with life, that has nothing to do with me.

Misteln: You are saying… from the very beginning until now, during this long, long period of time, you have never cared about them?

Vita: …

Vita: Why ask such a question? Isn’t that obvious?

Misteln: …Heh. Yes, very obvious.

Misteln, seemingly content with that answer, departed with a soft chuckle, foregoing further questions.

Vita resumed her emotionless expression as she quietly gazed at the distant scenery.

The children had gradually run off into the distance, their cheerful laughter like the chirping of birds in the early morning.

Veracious Vita: Argh, where exactly did I eat that most delicious candy?!

Erudite Vita: It’s okay, Yellow, we can make the most delicious candy together. Right, Orange?

Encompassing Vita: Of course, candies made by everyone together will surely be the most delicious.

Harmonious Vita: Hurry up! Griseo is about to tell a new story! Blue, stop daydreaming at the city wall and come over!

Mindful Vita: Right. Coming.

You see, this is truly a vibrant little world, isn’t it?

…

Someone not far away gazed at this ordinary yet precious scenery, leaving behind an answer no one shall ever know.

Or perhaps, it was never an answer at all.

Griseo: Ah!

Misteln: Hmm? What’s wrong, Griseo?

A cry of surprise interrupted Misteln’s reminiscence, and she looked at Griseo with concern.

Griseo: It’s Uncle Su.

Griseo: Uncle Su, what took you so long to contact me? What has everyone been doing lately? I have a lot of things to tell you.

Griseo: Hua told me about everyone’s stories in Qiming and introduced me to her new friends. They are all very interesting people.

Griseo: …Uncle Su, why aren’t you saying anything?

Su: …Griseo.

Su: I’m sorry. I cannot create too many karmic ties with your planet and disrupt the balance.

Griseo: …I understand.

Su: But you can go ask “them” yourself how they’ve been recently.

Griseo: Uncle Su?

…

The communication fell into silence again on the other end.

Then, the familiar voice and hues of longing came rushing in.

Finale - Accepting Communications
White Beach

Herrscher of Sentience: Hello? Hello! Can you hear me?

Veracious Vita: Wow, what a loud voice, even louder than Red!

Herrscher of Sentience: What? I’m testing the communication signal strength! Listen up, I’m the Herrscher of Sentience, and no one understands communication better than me!

Harmonious Vita: Sounds impressive! But, if you understand communication so well… Why haven’t you contacted Griseo for so long?

Herrscher of Sentience: Go back and read more books! Do you know what the “speed of light” is? Without tricks, the light from here to your place would take about twenty-six or seven days… even writing letters would be faster!

Herrscher of Sentience: Alright, alright, whatever. I’m not your teacher.

Herrscher of Sentience: Hey, Old Timer. You’ve been talking about your old friend for so long. Now that you've met her, why don’t you say a word?

Fu Hua: …

Fu Hua: Griseo, it’s been a while.

Griseo: Fu Hua! How have you been? I miss you a lot.

Fu Hua: I’m doing well. Thanks for asking.

Book of Fuxi: Fu Hua also misses you! What a blockhead she is, still so bad at expressing her feelings.

Herrscher of Sentience: Exactly! Along the way, whether looking at a tree or a flower, she would suddenly say, “I’ve seen such scenery in Griseo’s paintings”.

Fu Hua: …Lately, I often think about things that happened before. When I see similar scenery, distant memories come to mind.

Griseo: I understand. You experienced what I have at that time. Besides…

Griseo: Fu Hua has many friends now, just like I do, and will never be lonely again. Whether it’s today or tomorrow, every moment is equally precious and joyful.

Fu Hua: …Thank you, Griseo. How about you, feeling happy lately?

Griseo: Yes, being able to live with Red, Misteln, and the others in Qiming is really good, and I have a lot more subjects to paint.

Herrscher of Sentience: Huh? Misteln? If you’re living with that woman who deceives people, how can we not worry about you?

Misteln: Oh my, it seems the Herrscher of Sentience still can’t forget about the past. But, how does it feel to travel with me… that question should be best answered by No. 17, who is right next to you.

Prometheus: …

Prometheus: I refuse to answer.

Misteln: Come on, don’t be shy, No. 17. The time we spent together was unforgettable. Come and join me, the kids here are all as cute as you.

Prometheus: …Please remove those words that are irrelevant to your main point. Roughly calculating the current distance, even if I take the most advanced lightsail spacecraft on Earth, it would probably take me 73 years to reach the “New Qiming Star”.

Prometheus: On the other hand, considering the progress of industrial equipment manufacturing by the representatives and Griseo, you probably won’t need my help at all by then.

Misteln: Don’t be like that, No. 17. As my dearest confidant, you treat me way, way better than those cold and uncaring mining equipment.

Prometheus: Then wait patiently, Misteln. Wait for a day when I get tired of living on Earth.

Misteln: Alright, that’s a promise. I’ll be waiting here for you. After all, I’ve gotten quite used to waiting, haven’t I?

Prometheus: …

Prometheus: Forget it. Instead of that, you better wait for the people on Earth to develop a more efficient spacecraft.

Misteln: Well, until No. 17 joins me, I’ll grudgingly use those mining devices in your stead.

Misteln: Speaking of which… if I ask Griseo to paint them in No. 17’s colors, would the mining efficiency be improved?

Griseo: Well, rest assured, Misteln, I’ll repaint the mining equipment in No. 17’s colors after my patrol tomorrow.

Prometheus: …

Fu Hua: It seems that during this time, Griseo and Misteln have helped Qiming a lot.

Righteous Vita: Of course! Griseo and Hare are really great!

Fu Hua: Red? Long time no see.

Righteous Vita: Hehe, I finally see you again, Great Detective! Who knew that your “see you again” would take this long… truth be told, I was getting impatient waiting!

Fu Hua: How is everyone doing lately, what are you up to?

Harmonious Vita: We’ve been preparing for a very big celebration recently.

Veracious Vita: And Hare and Griseo will be performing as well. I heard Griseo is very good at it!

Fu Hua: Hmm? It seems Griseo has really grown a lot.

Griseo: Uh… actually, I haven’t decided what to perform yet.

Fu Hua: It’s okay, do what you want, everyone likes you just the way you are.

Griseo: I will.

Erudite Vita: I-If Fu Hua could come, it would be wonderful. Griseo and Hare have come up with a lot of ideas for everyone, and this celebration will definitely be very entertaining.

Fu Hua: Sorry, Cyan. Like Prometheus said, currently, we don’t have a feasible method for everyone to travel between Qiming and Earth.

Mindful Vita: It’s okay, Fu Hua. The past we experienced and the future we opened up together are the reasons everyone is holding a celebration. Even if you’re not in Qiming, this celebration has a part that belongs to you.

Encompassing Vita: Blue is right, it’s also your celebration. Don’t worry, everyone in Qiming is doing well, and you should take care of yourself. Be sure not to push yourself, okay?

Fu Hua: Thank you, Orange.

Righteous Vita: You can rest easy, Great Detective! We will work hard to make this city better and better… plus, now we have a lot of experiences from Earth to guide us!

Disciplined Vita: With the help of Griseo and Hare, the efficiency of managing the city has improved a lot. Compared to the past, many tasks are now accomplished effortlessly.

Fu Hua: That’s good to hear. Griseo has become an outstanding city representative within merely half a year.

Griseo: This is the job I want to do now. Whether it’s the colorful landscapes in paintings or the brilliant stories of the night sky, I will bring them to this city.

Fu Hua: …

Feeling sentimental, she looked at her companions she sorely missed on the communication screen. The pure colors in her memories intertwined with the gorgeous light and shadow before her, reminding Fu Hua of the starry sky she saw a long time ago while talking to Griseo, when she lifted her head and saw the Milky Way above.

The stars, pure and shimmering, reflected dazzling light, illuminating countless futures in the tranquil night sky.

And so, she smiled and nodded.

Fu Hua: Yes, I believe you can do it, Griseo.

Campus in Shade

Rozaliya: Liliya, Liliya, look. Someone is really appearing right in front of us!

Liliya: Rozaliya, Rozaliya, look. There really are seven kids!

Righteous Vita: We’re not kids. The seven of us are city representatives. Everyone seeks out our help when they have difficulties!

Seele: Oh, so you’re city representatives serving a whole city! That’s amazing!

Righteous Vita: Hehe, keep the praises coming!

Rozaliya: Seele, we’re pretty amazing too! Not only do we read picture books to the children and rehearse fairy tales every day, but we also make time to practice our idol skills.

Liliya: That’s right, we’re awesome too. But being both a trainee idol and the children’s teacher is really tiring. I just want to sleep all day.

Rozaliya: Shh… Liliya Idiotka, you’ve forgotten again. As professional idols under Kira’s guidance, it’s quite dangerous to complain about our work!

Liliya: Rozaliya Idiotka, we’re still just trainee idols….

Rozaliya: We’re not just trainee idols. The Vodka girls have already delivered some spectacular performances in the talent show!

Liliya: But we were still eliminated in the end…

Rozaliya: After that talent show, we carefully reflected on our shortcomings and, with the help of the Interstellar Idol Kira, underwent very professional training!

Liliya: We just never had vocal lessons… When I asked about it last time, Kira told us to consult Dr. Einstein.

Rozaliya: Even though we’re still far from our dream, taking action is always better than standing still. Putting in effort will always take us closer to our goal compared to doing nothing. It’s okay even if our progress is a little slow.

Rozaliya: Wow, Liliya, I unintentionally said something really impressive again! Let’s use it as our manifesto in the next talent show!

Liliya: …Next talent show?

Rozaliya: It’s next week! Theresa helped us to register for it. This time, not only do we have Kira’s professional guidance, but also everyone’s live support. We will definitely achieve very impressive results!

Liliya: …But you haven’t memorised the lines yet.

Rozaliya: Don’t worry, Liliya! As long as I, the genius Rozaliya, is with you, any talent show is a piece of cake!

Liliya: …Rozaliya Idiotka. Why are you indulging in futile self-consolation again?

Rozaliya: Rest assured, Liliya, I will definitely remember the lines in my spare time! Lately, rehearsing fairy tales with the children has been so much fun that I always forget to practice…

Rozaliya: …Liliya, you’re not angry, are you?

Liliya: I won’t get angry about such things, Idiotka.

Liliya: …And even if we are eliminated this time, it’ll be okay. We still want to be the best touring teachers and shining idols.

Rozaliya: Yes! After seeing everyone working happily and busily for their goals, we can’t afford to slack off. Just like Seele, she’s teaching children and participating in Schicksal training too.

Liliya: Yeah, Seele is really amazing.

Seele: D-Don’t say that. I’m just doing whatever I can within my ability. The school’s enriching activities wouldn’t be possible without everyone’s help.

Encompassing Vita: So you’re all teachers and even organised such rich and colorful educational programs.

Seele: Yeah, we’re all guest instructors under the Cioara Foundation. Seele, Rozaliya, Liliya, and another two teachers who joined remotely, they always bring exciting creativity to the classroom.

Seele: All of them have been working hard.

Seele: What foolish things are you saying again? You are the one who preps for classes until late at night, even on training days.

Seele: Eh? How did you know that?

Seele: Because… Anyway, teaching those little devils was your own decision, and everyone is responsible for it. Don’t take on everything by yourself and then give all the credit to others.

Abnormal Stigmata 0014: Seele is right. This job is a self-chosen part-time job for us and is meaningful to us in our own way. Being able to do something beneficial for everyone after leaving Stigmata Space makes us happy.

Abnormal Stigmata 0015: Yes! Being able to play games and read fairy tales with so many interesting children every day is so much fun.

Misteln: It seems that you two have found the answer to becoming “human”.

Abnormal Stigmata 0015: Do you think so as well, Misteln? Seele said the same to us!

Abnormal Stigmata 0014: Misteln, we will find a way to help you regain your freedom. No matter how much time it takes, we will work hard for it.

Misteln: Finding your own answer is the best help for me. So, for this hard-won answer, please continue to move forward with this precious “treasure”.

Abnormal Stigmata 0014: But, you can’t leave the “New Qiming Star” now, and we can’t just leave you alone…

Misteln: Well, I’m free now. I can live with the lovely children and don’t have to work as hard as Griseo and Seele. Isn’t that great?

Misteln: Besides, whether on Earth or in a bubble universe, people can’t leave the world they live in. That’s what life is, right?

Abnormal Stigmata 0014: …You’re still the same as always.

Misteln: I, along with Griseo, and those children… everyone is working hard to make Qiming better, and every day is fulfilling. Because of this fulfillment, we always find new joy.

Misteln: This feeling is somewhat similar to that of “raising game characters”. I’m sure you can relate to it.

Seele: Griseo… is she the one Fu Hua mentioned?

Griseo: …Seele, right?

Seele: Hmm? Ah, hello, Griseo.

Griseo: Although this is our first meeting… after hearing the stories that Fu Hua told me, I feel like I’ve already experienced many adventures with all of you.

Seele: Fu Hua also shared your experiences traveling on the Ark with everyone, and the children at the school are very curious about the stories from the stars.

Griseo: Really? The residents of Qiming also enjoy hearing me tell those stories. If there’s a chance, I would also like to depict the colors of the stars to more people.

Seele: That’s great, Griseo. I’ve been thinking lately that if everyone could take turns being a “one-day teacher” at the school, the children might get to broaden their minds.

Griseo: “One-day teacher”... does that mean having everyone teach the children for a day?

Seele: Yes, that’s right. Teaching through a communication device would also be fine.

Griseo: Seele really is a person full of ideas, just as Fu Hua said.

Seele: Everyone has unique experiences, and I hope these meaningful stories can be passed down in the hearts of the children.

Seele: …This is just my preliminary idea. I still need to gather more suggestions from everyone.

Book of Fuxi: Being a teacher who imparts knowledge and tells stories… sounds like something a blockhead would be good at.

Book of Fuxi: Fu Hua, should we go and take a look? Maybe you’ll get to see quite a few friends.

Fu Hua: …Alright, if everyone is willing, we’ll set off in a few days to take a look.

Herrscher of Sentience: Oh? Being a teacher! I’ll have to put some serious thought into what I’m going to teach, then. After all, as the Herrscher of Sentience, I possess extensive knowledge and profound insights. I must speak in a way that’s both deep and easy to grasp, or else those little rascals might not follow.

Seele: You? Ha, if Cioara visits the school during the holidays and sees you leading a group of kids shouting “Long live!” in the classroom, she might just break down in tears and throw a tantrum on the spot.

Herrscher of Sentience: Hey, what are you talking about?! When did I ever do anything like that?

Seele: It seems the Herrscher of Sentience is not only prone to “leading the youth astray”, but suffers from a somewhat faulty memory.

Herrscher of Sentience: Seele, are you afraid that the knowledgeable and popular Herrscher of Sentience will steal your limelight in front of the children? You’re not jealous, are you?

Seele: Huh? Jealous? Wherever did you get such a childish and bizarre idea?

Herrscher of Sentience: You…

Book of Fuxi: *sigh* She hasn’t changed a bit, has she?

Herrscher of Sentience: Hey, Old Timer Number Two! She started it!

Fu Hua: Herrscher of Sentience, Seele wants to bring meaningful knowledge to children, just like you. You can discuss specific teaching methods after you both reach a consensus on this.

Herrscher of Sentience: Fine, fine. Considering our past experiences together, I’ll be the bigger person here.

Seele: Hahaha, Seele was right. In front of Fu Hua and the Book of Fuxi, you really turned into a model student all of a sudden.

Herrscher of Sentience: Hey…

Seele: Seele… If Fu Hua and the Herrscher of Sentience could spare some time to teach the children, it would be very meaningful, right?

Seele: …

Seele: Fine. Yes, yes. It would be.

Herrscher of Sentience: Hahaha, so remind me, Seele, who were you so boldly criticising just a moment ago?

Fu Hua: Seele, if everything is okay, we will set off in a few days. Whether it’s the Herrscher of Sentience, Prometheus, or the Book of Fuxi, we have a lot of experiences to share with everyone.

Book of Fuxi: Hmm, besides travel experiences, I can also tell the children many, many mythological stories. This way, the book “Story King” that Fuxi and Nuwa helped me bind with can finally come in handy.

Book of Fuxi: Uh… maybe the book “Joke Collection” can help liven up the atmosphere in the class for the blockhead? But with the Herrscher of Sentience, there’s no need to worry too much about that.

Herrscher of Sentience: That’s for sure! The admired Herrscher of Sentience can handle everything.

Liliya: I have always felt that the Herrscher of Sentience’s sense of pride is somewhat unique.

Rozaliya: Huh? You think so? But still, I think the Herrscher of Sentience is pretty well-suited for performing fairy tales with the children! Then, the Book of Fuxi and Fu Hua can be in charge of storytelling, and Prometheus can talk about scientific knowledge…

Rozaliya: …Umm, in that case, what would the two of us do, Liliya?

Liliya: Simple. We can take a good rest.

Rozaliya: Hey! Liliya, as the best touring teachers out there, we definitely can’t afford to slack off! Ah, right! The Vodka Girls shall join the kids in their games! They can finally play freely to their heart’s content!

Seele: Haha, when Fu Hua and the others arrive at the school, we can discuss together what new activities to organise for the children.

Griseo: Seele, I will also ask Uncle Su to help us communicate more, so that the children from Qiming and Earth can have more opportunities to learn from each other.

Seele: Okay. Such a future is bound to be interesting.

Studio Reason

Mei: …

Bronya: Still not going through yet, Mei?

Bronya: Let me check… the signal is good, and there’s no delay… why aren’t you speaking?

Bronya followed Mei’s gaze and soon understood the reason for this silence.

Bronya: …I’ll go look for a new game cartridge. I’ll be back in a bit.

Mei: …

Griseo: Huh?

Mei: Ah… um… Nice to meet you, Griseo. I’m Mei Raiden.

Griseo: Mei… you have everyone’s colors on you.

Mei: …Oh, yes.

Griseo: Right. You are the Herrscher of Origin.

Griseo: Mei, you and your companions have created the vision you anticipated with your own thoughts and ultimately painted it with your colors. This is the proof of the eternal existence of the “Elysian Realm”, isn’t it?

Mei: Griseo…

Griseo: What’s wrong, Mei?

Mei: …Nothing.

Mei: Compared to the child who was easily “influenced” by various “colors”, the Griseo now already has many “colors” of her own.

Griseo: “Influenced” by the colors of others… Ah.

Griseo: The me in the Elysian Realm at that time… I said a lot of strange things, imitating Mei, right?

Mei: Haha… like, “Paintbrush, submit to my will”?

Griseo: Huh?

Griseo: That phrase sounded quite cool, didn’t it?

Mei: Yes, it does.

“I must be playing in the clouds now, where there are warm swans, diligent hedgehogs, and maybe crabs made of candy, right?”

Suddenly, these awkward words echoed in her ears, a fantasy of young Griseo about the Ark’s journey, a lie she couldn’t bear to deny.

At that time, she could not have imagined that the Griseo now would have her own answer.

Mei: …

Because she is Griseo, she can face the long journey with a pure heart. Because she is Griseo, she can explore her colors with endless imagination in the silent starry sky.

She smiled, the image of the old friend in front of her overlapped with the figure of the child in her memories and extended to the future with infinite possibilities.

Griseo: …

Griseo: Mei, why did you suddenly stop talking? Are you recalling the things from the Elysian Realm?

Mei: …Yes, I am. Those experiences are very precious to me.

Griseo: I see. The events recorded in the Elysian Realm passed so long ago that I have little impression of them left.

Mei: …

…For Griseo now, are those gradually fading memories a warm past, a sorrowful history, or regrets shrouded in shadows when recalled?

Mei couldn’t come up with an answer, but she understood that whether or not Griseo should know the story of the Elysian Realm… it should be left for Griseo to choose.

Mei: Griseo, if you want to know those memories, I can describe them to you.

Griseo: …

Griseo: …No need, Mei. I’m used to moving forward now.

Mei: …I see.

Griseo: Yeah. The starry sea behind us is stories that have already been explored. They give humanity resources, knowledge, and emotions.

Griseo: But our journey always goes to the next star, where there are the beautiful unknown, opportunities, and the future of humanity.

Mei: You are not only an excellent city representative, but also a mature astronaut now, Griseo.

Griseo: Thanks.

Griseo: I will take care of this city with the Vitas and witness its civilisation grow brilliant and magnificent. And in the future, maybe I will set out into the starry sea again, furthering my beloved “Project ARK”.

Mei: …Yes. The stories of the predecessors will eventually stay in the past, becoming history. And we, along with generation after generation of humanity, will move toward tomorrow in our own way.

Mei: And someday… our history will also, along with those stories, become the trajectory of civilisation, carrying the people after us toward a newer future.

Griseo: …Like them, we will surely be proud of ourselves, right?

Mei: Yes, of course.

Moon Base

Kiana: Uh…

Kiana: Mei, Bronya, you two haven’t changed at all.

Bronya: …Hey, we just met yesterday, how would there be any changes?

Mei: Yeah, Kiana, you played games with us last night.

Kiana: Today is different, Mei.

Bronya: …Ah, indeed.

Mei: …?

Bronya: The communication line provided by Su has almost no delay. In theory…

Bronya: It’s perfect for people across the universe to play online games together.

Mei: I see.

Kiana: You know what? For true professional and elite gamers, even a millisecond of delay can affect our in-game controls and performance.

Mei: …This might be more persuasive if it were coming from Bronya.

Kiana: My gaming skills have been improving all along. Last time, Bronya gave me her newly made game, and I easily cleared it! Bronya also redesigned some parts based on my suggestions!

Kiana: Looks like even someone as smart as Bronya has a day when she listens to my advice.

Bronya: …Listening to feedback is an important part of development, that’s all.

Kiana: Well, my suggestions were very useful.

Mei: Haha, proud of yourself, I see.

Kiana: Mei, you’re laughing at me again! What did I say wrong?

Mei: I just feel like the three of us… seem to have returned to our time at St. Freya.

Kiana: Hmm, that’s true.

Kiana: Now, not only do I have to attend classes and do homework, but I also have to deal with Mei making sure I don’t eat instant noodles. The homework at Anti-Entropy is much harder than anything at St. Freya.

Mei: Well, when Bronya and I visited you last time, we found out you had started eating a whole lot more instant noodles just so that you could carve out more time for gaming.

Kiana: It’s all Bronya’s fault for not telling me that you guys would come early.

Bronya: That’s because Mei wanted to give you a little surprise. Who would have thought that as soon as we entered, we would see a table full of instant noodle boxes and a panicked idiot.

Kiana: Hehe, don’t worry, Mei. The desserts you made last time were delicious, and I won’t resort to instant noodles again.

Bronya: Of course Mei won’t worry about it again. She’s got something on Klein, and had made her promise not to peddle any more junk food to you.

Kiana: No… Mei, how could you…

Mei: Well, because when it comes to eating, you always find a way to get what you want.

Kiana: Ahahaha…

Kiana: Alright, alright… But as compensation, Mei, you have to come often to make desserts for me and play games with us!

Mei: Haha, desserts are not a problem. As for games… The co-op game we played together last time felt pretty good, playing as little animals messing with each other… it was quite fun.

Kiana: Then, let’s start with this game! We’ll team up and give Bronya the shock and awe as we defeat her with our team-play!

Bronya: If we play it during a party, Seele will definitely be interested. Make sure you don’t admit defeat too early when that happens, Kiana.

Seele: Is Bronya going to organise a game session for everyone again?

Bronya: Seele, you came at the right time. Besides playing games, how about going for a walk together tonight? I saw the scenery photos that Fu Hua took, and they gave me a sudden urge to head out somewhere.

Seele: Then how about going to the seaside? It’s not good for you to always stay cooped up in the office.

Bronya: Alright, Seele. I’ll take your advice.

Kiana: Oh, are you guys heading out? Don’t tell me you’re gonna have some seafood barbecue?

???: Ahem!

Kiana: Huh?

A familiar voice came, and the girl on the moon instinctively straightened up.

Theresa: Stop drooling! Did you finish Dr. Tesla’s electromagnetics homework, Ki-a-na?

Kiana: Eh, what? Auntie!

Theresa: Don’t get all panicky now. I heard from Nagamitsu that your accuracy on the calculus exercises has always been lamentable. And you haven’t even submitted the programming assignment assigned last week as well.

Kiana: …Huh? Auntie, you… what are you saying? I can’t hear you clearly…

Theresa: Drop the act, Kiana. We’ve already established that this is a completely delay-free communication. You can hear me loud and clear!

Kiana: Huh? Auntie, why is your projection so blurry? Are you talking? Oops, I can’t hear you clearly, so I’m gonna drop the call now.

Theresa: I’m asking, when are you going to submit your homework?!

Kiana: Goodbye, homework… Uh, no, goodbye, Auntie! Goodbye, Mei, Bronya, everyone!

Theresa: KIANA!

Schicksal HQ

Rita: Master Durandal, the communication line has connected.

Durandal: Overseer Theresa, everyone, it’s been a while.

Theresa: Durandal, Rita, long time no see. I seem to recall that today Sushang and Kira are supposed to come to the training room. Why aren’t they there?

Rita: Rest assured, Overseer. Susannah has already gone to meet the two of them, and I believe they will arrive soon.

Susannah: Overseer Theresa, Master Durandal, and Master Rita, I have brought everyone here on time, mission accomplished!

Li Sushang: It’s quite a coincidence that we can see so many people on video as soon as we arrive, how lively!

Shigure Kira: Bianka, Rita, Seele, and everyone, long time no see!

Misteln: Hi, Miss Kira.

Shigure Kira: Uh… H-Hi.

Misteln: Hmm? Kira, do you want to say something to me?

Shigure Kira: …

Shigure Kira: …N-Nothing. I just feel like I owe you an apology… I hope it’s not too late to say these things now. Of course, it’s okay if you don’t accept it.

Misteln: Well, apology well-received. Thank you.

Shigure Kira: …Thank you?

Misteln: Yes, I’m not human, and I can’t truly experience human emotions, so I often do things that lead to misunderstandings.

Misteln: Even if I encounter things that would make a human feel sad, upset, or distressed, I can’t truly share the exact same emotions. While it’s not a “fatal flaw”...

Misteln: You had apologised to me for those misunderstandings. That means you see me as a “human” with human-like emotions, or as a friend, isn’t that right?

Shigure Kira: Uh, I’d like to say that wasn’t really my intention… but saying it that way isn’t entirely wrong either.

Misteln: So, Kira, when friends express their feelings, do they do it like this?

Shigure Kira: …?

Misteln: Try saying something like this to me… “No matter what, we will always be friends. Even if there are misunderstandings or conflicts, I will always cherish the time I spend with you.”

Shigure Kira: You…

Misteln: Alright, I’m just kidding.

Shigure Kira: …If I had known I’d need to talk to you, I wouldn’t have come.

Susannah: Huh? Miss Kira, when you saw everyone talking just now, you seemed so happy. I remember at that time Misteln also appeared on the screen.

Shigure Kira: …Susannah, you have such a good memory, so how’d you get us lost just now?

Susannah: S-Sorry… Miss Kira.

Li Sushang: Don’t worry, Susannah. It’s not easy to get familiar with this place. We looked for the way together this time, and we’ll definitely remember it next time!

Susannah: T-Thank you, Master Sushang! I’ll do my best to memorise the way and become the best guide for everyone!

Rita: Thank you for helping us train new members and film the Schicksal promotional program, Master Sushang and Miss Kira.

Li Sushang: Don’t mention it. I’ve been traveling outside for so long, and have been itching to test my skills. It’s time to stretch my muscles!

Shigure Kira: Schicksal’s training methods are quite different from before, and it’s a new experience for me too. During breaks, I can also share some interesting stories about young “Master Durandal” with the new members.

Susannah: Wow, Miss Kira, I want to hear them too!

Durandal: Uh… Miss Kira, please be merciful.

Durandal: Ah, right. Recently, we happened to launch a special long-term project, and we need to train a few talented special operatives. Miss Kira and Sushang, please do give them some advice when you are free.

Shigure Kira: “A special long-term project”?

Durandal: Yes. Since it’s still in the confidential stage, it’s more convenient to tell you the specific content at the practice range. But rest assured, it’s indeed a project very suitable for “Idols of the Universe” to share their experiences.

Shigure Kira: …?

Li Sushang: By the way, Durandal, Rita, besides the training room, is there anything fun around here?

Rita: …Do you mean to find an arcade, Master Sushang? There’s one not too far from here. I can take you there.

Li Sushang: Uh, I have to take a break from playing games… Last time, when Bronya heard that I also had this hobby, she specially brought her new game to me.

Li Sushang: *sigh* It was so difficult! My head felt like it was splitting in two while playing it. Ever since then, I’ve not ever wanted to touch a game console again. I really don’t understand how Kiana could fill out that feedback form with “very easy”.

Rita: I see. Then how about observing the stars with us when you’re free? It’s quite fascinating as well. All of you may join us too, if you’re interested.

Li Sushang: Observing the stars?

Rita: Yes, observing various star clusters in the Milky Way via the professional instrument made by Master Nagamitsu. If the weather is good, we can see many unimaginably beautiful sights.

Li Sushang: Isn’t this like seeing a thousand miles away without leaving the house? The “clairvoyance” mentioned in stories has finally come true, then.

Li Sushang: But the world now is really changing rapidly, and storytellers can’t keep up with the imagination of scientists and designers.

Durandal: This is what they call “accumulations leading to breakthroughs”. Each generation has its own challenges… our predecessors blazed the trail, and the generations that follow must shoulder even greater responsibilities.

Durandal: The torch of humanity that is now in our hands is also urging us to fulfill our unfinished tasks. From generation to generation, this has always been the case.

Siegfried: Hahaha, I always find it hard to interrupt when it comes to such topics.

Durandal: …Dad?

Siegfried: Hello, have you been resting well lately? To be honest, I advise you to not take on training the newcomers all by yourself. Work isn’t something you do alone, and you should always strive to give your team enough opportunities.

Siegfried: In my opinion, both you and Rita should just find a villa to hide in, and leave everything to your team members… maybe they’ll experience unexpected growth.

Theresa: Siegfried, I’m still here. You don’t expect me, the principal, to approve such kind of brutal training methods, do you?

Siegfried: Hahaha, alright, alright. Theresa’s pretty stubborn and won’t listen to anything I say, so I have to exaggerate to get her attention.

Siegfried: If she ever sneakily plays games during work one day, then I’ll be at ease.

Durandal: Uh… I’ll try to arrange more time for myself.

Durandal: Oh, by the way… There happens to be a mission to the moon the weekend after the next week. How about I get a few more people to join, and after completing the mission, we all play soccer with Kiana? She said she spent a lot of time practicing, and was dying to show off her skills.

Siegfried: Oh? Is that true? I'll be looking forward to it.

Kiana: *cough* Dad, you should definitely look forward to it. Why don’t you also invite Mr. Yang? I want to team up with my sister.

Durandal: Kiana, it’s been a while.

Kiana: Hmm, not really… I haven’t finished reading the book you gave me last time.

Siegfried: Oh? Kiana, are you into reading now? I remember this morning Theresa told me that you haven’t submitted last week’s homework.

Kiana: Whoa, Aunt Theresa, when did you learn to tell on kids?

Theresa: I’m still here. Kiana… is your signal better now?

Kiana: Uh… hehe, Aunt Theresa, I’m on it, really! But Dad, what about you? It’s working hours now, are you slacking on your job too?

Siegfried: O-Of course not! For all of you, I always try to lead by example.

Kiana: But Dad looks like he just finished drinking. Don’t you agree, Sis?

Durandal: Suspicious indeed. Can’t rule out the possibility.

Siegfried: …D-Do I? Does your Dad really look like someone who would sneak out to drink during work hours?

Durandal & Kiana: Very much so.

Theresa: Hahahahahaha.

Siegfried: Ahem, I got a little excited discussing work with Welt, that’s why my face turned red. Ah, it’s getting late, and I still have other tasks to get on with. I’ll look forward to seeing your skills next time!

Durandal: Yeah, no problem.

Kiana: Don’t worry, Dad, we won’t let you down! Just wait and see!

Anti-Entropy Meeting Room

Tesla: Mophead, come here! This is a golden opportunity for real-time communication and getting firsthand data… it’s perfect since Nagamitsu isn’t around. She’ll definitely need me later!

Einstein: Dr. Einstein, I must remind you… have you forgotten that we have more important things to do?

Tesla: Isn’t it just locating Siegfried, catching him, and making him work? Hehe, Mophead, now that everyone is here, let me ask if anyone has seen Siegfried.

Kiana: Huh, are Dr. Tesla and Dr. Einstein looking for Dad?

Einstein: Yeah, we briefly detected his presence just now, but before we could lock onto his location, the signal disappeared again.

Tesla: His little tricks won’t let him escape from our grasp. Today, I must bring him back to work hard! Without him and Joachim, our efficiency drops significantly! We can’t rely on Schrodinger every time!

Einstein: …So, has anyone seen Siegfried?

Kiana: You’ve asked the right person. Dad just appeared on the communication device, his face beet-red. Both my sister and I think he’s been drinking with Mr. Yang!

Einstein: It seems that as long as we locate Joachim’s position, we can find Siegfried as well.

As she finished speaking, Welt’s figure coincidentally appeared before everyone.

Welt Yang: Oh, everyone’s here, long time no see.

Kiana: Mr. Yang, you came at the right time!

Welt Yang: …Oh? What’s going on, Kiana?

Tesla: Hey, I need a little more time to track the signal. You guys stall him for me.

Kiana: No problem, Doctor, leave it to me!

Welt Yang: Huh?

Kiana: Mr. Yang, were you just drinking with my Dad?

Welt Yang: So that’s what it was… No wonder Siegfried suddenly ran off while he was drinking. He seemed to be in a good mood. Is he going to see you guys again?

Kiana: Yes. The weekend after next week, Dad and my sister are coming to play soccer with me! Mr. Yang, you should come too, and we can form two teams!

Welt Yang: Haha, if I have time, I’ll definitely join. However, since we’re going to the moon in a while, I should take this opportunity to have a few more drinks with him. You guys continue chatting. I’ll go find Siegfried.

Kiana: Uh, wait a minute, Mr. Yang…

Welt Yang: Is there anything else, Kiana?

Kiana: It’s, it’s just… L-Let me think about what else to say…

Einstein: Stall him a little bit more, Kiana.

Welt Yang: Huh?

Bronya: Kiana Idiotka, leave this kind of thing to the professionals. Hi, nice to meet you, Mr. Yang.

Welt Yang: …Bronya, how can I help you? Oh, I remember now. You can rest easy, I’ll finish revising the plan you sent me within this month.

Bronya: But Mr. Yang, aren’t you going to the moon soon? Don’t you have a lot of preparations to do?

Welt Yang: …I’ll carve out an appropriate time to do it. Believe me, Bronya.

Bronya: But I remember the plan was sent to you a month ago.

Welt Yang: …Haha, how time flies.

Bronya: And did you test the trial level I uploaded yesterday? How did it feel? Are there any areas that need further optimisation?

Welt Yang: Uh, it’s hard to explain in one sentence. We better discuss it face-to-face.

Bronya: Okay, when should we meet? How about tomorrow morning, at Studio Reason?

Welt Yang: Uh… it’s not that urgent, is it? Wait, it seems Siegfried is looking for me. I have to go. Goodbye, Bronya. Goodbye, everyone.

Bronya: The same excuse as always… Maybe the next time I see him, Studio Reason will have a completely different set of projects.

Tesla: Don’t worry, Bronya! Mophead has set the boundaries for both of them… now neither of them can escape!

Kiana: Dr. Tesla, Dr. Einstein, well done!

Mei: Kiana, why are you so happy that the doctors are taking Mr. Yang and Mr. Siegfried back to work?

Kiana: Mei, think about it. While Mr. Yang and Dad are chatting and drinking, I’m doing homework… it’s so unfair.

Mei: Haha, be careful. If the principal hears what you just said, she’ll ask you about your homework again.

Kiana: *sigh* Mei, you’re becoming more and more like a teacher… No, actually, Mei is already an excellent teacher.

Mei: I’ve just started my internship. There’s still a lot to learn from my seniors. After all…

Kiana: …?

Mei: I have a troublesome student in front of me who hasn’t finished her homework for a week.

Kiana: I-I’ll definitely finish it today.

Kiana: Well, I always said you would become a good teacher, Mei. You are so skilled even in chasing for homework, and I’m not even your student yet.

Mei: Haha, but you’re Kiana, aren’t you?

Beep…

Einstein: We’ve successfully located Siegfried’s position, and Joachim is nearby.

Tesla: Hmm, excellent. I’ll set off now and bring them both back.

Kiana: We need Dad and Mr. Yang to finish their work quickly so that we can have time for you all to go to the moon! Mei, Bronya, make sure to keep your schedules open.

Mei: Okay. I’ll also prepare some desserts you like.

Kiana: Great! Oh, how about we cook a great meal together? I want to help!

Bronya: …It’s probably best not to let a Kaslana enter the kitchen.

Kiana: Don’t underestimate me, Bronya. People grow.

Bronya: Really? Then I should finish the next version of the plan quickly to leave enough time to taste your cooking.

Seele: Seeing Bronya’s efforts, I must work hard too. But Bronya, you must take care of yourself.

Bronya: Yeah, you too, Seele. As for work, Project Bunny can now handle 80% of the tasks independently.

Seele: …Then that’s Project Bunny’s effort. Also, Seele, you shouldn’t think of doing all the schoolwork alone.

Seele: I understand. This is something we need to accomplish together, a goal for us to strive for.

Rozaliya: Right, the genius Rozaliya and the idiot Liliya will shine with idol-like passion and become the best touring teachers!

Liliya: You are so noisy, Rozaliya Idiotka. You’re drowning out even Sora’s call for everyone to eat.

Book of Fuxi: …Uh, is it time to eat? I just had a beautiful nap… Fu Hua, should we go to that new restaurant today?

Fu Hua: Yeah, no problem.

Book of Fuxi: Oh, by the way, after returning from Seele’s school, where should we travel next?

Fu Hua: Perhaps as you said, we should have a tour around Shenzhou, participating in the festivals we missed in previous years together. If you have other ideas, feel free to share them.

Herrscher of Sentience: Heh, traveling with you feels all the same. I don’t have the energy to stay with you for the entire journey… you all know how to find me if you need anything.

Book of Fuxi: So as long as she, the blockhead, speaks, the Herrscher of Sentience will arrive in an instant. That’s what you wanted to say, wasn’t it?

Herrscher of Sentience: Nonsense! What do you think I am? A pet messenger pigeon or something?

Book of Fuxi: Ah, my bad. But I feel that, as long as I can be with Fu Hua, I’m happy no matter where I go. However…

Book of Fuxi: The most important thing now is… to fill my belly with local delicacies!

Fu Hua: Haha, then let’s go.

Durandal: By the way, Rita, isn’t it almost lunchtime for Stan?

Rita: Don’t worry, Master Durandal. Stan has already had his afternoon tea.

Rita: Also, Susannah has already taken Master Sushang and Miss Kira to the training room. Master Amber will give them specific instructions for the remaining training today.

Durandal: …

Rita: Hmm? Is there anything else, Master Durandal?

Durandal: …Nothing. Let’s go for coffee later.

Rita: Alright.

Fu Hua: By the way, it’s already December.

Book of Fuxi: Yeah. I hope that when we celebrate the New Year, we can see more beautiful fireworks than in previous years and eat lots of delicious things we’ve never seen before.

Herrscher of Sentience: Ha, why bother with these festive things? As long as we’re happy, every day is a festival. We can be together whenever we feel like it, there’s no need to force a gathering just for the sake of it!

Fu Hua: Haha, you’re right. Our past experiences, memories, and emotions… they’ve always been here. Or to put it another way…

Fu Hua: No matter where we travel, we will always return to where we belong.

To the Future

[CG plays wherein Griseo stands amidst the city of Qiming, watching on as everyone enjoys their now peaceful lives on Earth:

Herrscher of Sentience: Alright, alright, don’t yap so much.

Herrscher of Sentience: Let’s eat and drink, come on.

Fu Hua: Sure, I’m on my way.

Kiana: Everyone’s gotta try my pizza toast.

Mei: Of course, I can’t wait.

Seele: The beach is gonna be gorgeous tonight.

Seele: Let’s prepare to leave early.

Seele: You’ll know once you see it.

Bronya: It gets chilly at night during this season. Bring some extra clothes.

Rozaliya: Everyone hurry up, there’s cake today.

Liliya: Early birds get two servings.

Rita: When night falls, let’s take Stan for a walk too.
