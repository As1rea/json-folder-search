===Act 1 - Moonlit Oath===

====<u>Gameplay 28-1 - To the End</u>====
'''Otto:''' …That’s right.

'''Otto:''' Come and try to stop me, Durandal, Kiana, and… Theresa.

'''Otto:''' I’ll consider this as… your farewell performance for me.

Otto looked at the lights enveloping the church.

They emitted a sacred shine, like stairs leading to the heavens.

…

Meanwhile, outside the church.

'''Kiana:''' (What’s going on…? I can feel my power, but can’t use it…)

As her greatsword was broken, Kiana could only watch Otto leisurely merge into that strange light curtain.

But when she tried to follow him in, she felt her hair stand on end, as if every cell in her body was stopping her.

'''Kiana:''' (What is… with this light curtain? Something’s off…)

'''Bronya:''' Kiana!

'''Kiana:''' Huh? Bronya?

'''Bronya:''' Kiana, are you alright?

'''Kiana:''' I’m okay… but I failed to stop Otto. As we were fighting, this light curtain popped up and cut me off from him. He’s on the other side of it now.

'''Liliya:''' Uh…

'''Rozaliya:''' Huh? Lili, are you alright? This is not the time to be nodding off!

'''Rozaliya:''' We have to… Huh? Why am I also sleepy all of a sudden?

'''Seele:''' Roza? Lili?

'''Bronya:''' …The closer I get here, the heavier my body feels. It’s similar to when my power was taken away by the puppet, but it’s not the same…

'''Theresa:''' Hello? Are the comms working? Can anybody hear me?

'''Kiana:''' Principal? This is Kiana. The comms are working normally, and I just met Bronya and the others in front of the church.

'''Theresa:''' Phew, you guys are alright. The comms signal has been unstable since we started sometime ago. I was worried that you’d become unreachable, like Mr. Yang.

'''Theresa:''' From the Hyperion, the Doctors and I saw a huge light curtain appear in the direction of the church. Its energy parameters were very abnormal. Did you find anything at the scene?

'''Kiana:''' The light curtain could be some kind of measure Otto adopted to keep us out. He entered the church alone after it went up.

'''Theresa:''' So, you met Otto…

'''Kiana:''' Yes, when the light curtain appeared, he said something about “the gift from the Imaginary Tree” and “the power of God”…

'''Kiana:''' By the way, when I arrived, he was holding the Abyss Flower in his hand and said that it was left by “the first guest”.

'''Theresa:''' The Abyss Flower? His first guest? Did he mean… Durandal?

'''Tesla:''' Isn’t she Otto’s subordinate? Are they fighting?

'''Kiana:''' I don’t know… Anyway, everyone is isolated by the light curtain outside the church, and the Abyss Flower is right in front of us.

'''Kiana:''' Also, the strange thing is… this light curtain seems to be consuming and restricting Herrscher abilities.

'''Einstein:''' …

'''Einstein:''' Madam Theresa, what do you think?

'''Theresa:''' There’s no doubt. All the evidence suggests…

'''Theresa:''' That the light curtain is very likely the manifestation of the Herrscher of Binding’s power, just like Elysion Pedion.

'''Bronya:''' What?

'''Kiana:''' The Herrscher of Binding?! Are you saying that the Herrscher of Binding is in this small town?

'''Einstein:''' Calm down, everyone. We are talking about the Herrscher of Binding’s power. At the very least, we have not detected any signs of a new Herrscher Core.

'''Theresa:''' Even a simulated Oath of Judah is unable to generate such a massive field…

'''Einstein:''' Combined with what Otto said, it’s more like some kind of power from the Imaginary Tree.

'''Tesla:''' In any case, the situation is dire. We have to find a way to deal with the light curtain as soon as possible. We need to go in there and teach that Otto a lesson!

'''Theresa:''' Kiana, Bronya, take everyone back to the safe zone first. I will discuss the light curtain with the Doctors.

'''Theresa:''' Remember, never get close to the light curtain! If it really is the power of Binding, it could have irreversible effects on your body!

'''Kiana:''' Yeah, good idea.

--

====<u>Gameplay 28-2 - Fire</u>====
Meanwhile, in the Hyperion Command Center.

'''Tesla:''' Grr! That really sets me off! That jerk, why can’t he play fair? What’s he doing hiding in a church? Huh?

'''Einstein:''' Calm down, Dr. Tesla. Complaining won’t solve anything. Besides…

'''Einstein:''' We still have some tricks up our sleeve.

'''Tesla:''' …Huh? You have an idea, Mophead? Tell me, now!

'''Einstein:''' Maybe we can try to break that light curtain with the Selene.

'''Theresa:''' The Selene? But isn’t that the weapon we used against the Herrscher of the Void?

'''Einstein:''' The reason why the Selene is effective against Herrschers is because it can convert the Honkai energy in a Herrscher’s body into regular energy. In other words, the Selene’s attack isn’t part of the Honkai.

'''Einstein:''' As long as we supply it with additional Honkai energy, it could be used as a laser with amazing power.

'''Einstein:''' Initially, against the power of Binding, using a Herrscher’s power or even regular Honkai energy against it would be like bringing a knife to a gun fight…

'''Tesla:''' But if we’re using conventional energy weaponry, we don’t have to worry about that. We can push full steam ahead with an attack!

'''Tesla:''' Shoot, I knew I should have brought along all the Silver Bullets!

'''Einstein:''' …Then you’d have to take the innocent bystanders into account.

'''Einstein:''' One thing is curtain: no matter how the light curtain acquired the power of Binding, it must have some kind of operating mechanism to dissipate the energy.

'''Einstein:''' Every operating mechanism functions within a threshold. The power of Binding can naturally dissolve regular energy as well, but that is not its primary target…

'''Einstein:''' So our output will more than likely exceed that threshold.

'''Tesla:''' Like a battering ram against a stone, it’s a matter of brute force.

'''Einstein:''' Indeed.

'''Theresa:''' But… what if the Selene’s power can’t reach the threshold of the light curtain?

'''Einstein:''' Then we’ll have to find another way.

'''Theresa:''' …

'''Tesla:''' That is to say, to be on the safe side, we should use all the stored energy on the Hyperion and hope for the best!

'''Einstein:''' But on the other hand, if the Selene outputs at maximum power… once we fail, we will lose all of the Hyperion’s combat power.

'''Theresa:''' Indeed… Otto doesn’t seem too bothered. He might have a backup.

'''Theresa:''' Either way, the plan is good enough. I will inform Kiana and the others first…

'''Theresa:''' We’ll leave the power setting of the Selene and any other preparations to you, Doctors.

'''Tesla:''' No problem. Let’s play Rock Paper Scissors for it!

…A few minutes later.

'''Theresa:''' Kiana, Bronya, can you hear me?

'''Kiana:''' Loud and clear, Principal.

'''Bronya:''' What are the instructions?

'''Theresa:''' The Doctors and I will try to use the Selene to deal with the light curtain in front of the church. You lead everyone away, somewhere out of reach, as soon as possible.

'''Theresa:''' At that time, if our plan is successful, you’ll be able to enter the light curtain once it’s safe, then find Otto… I will catch up with you shortly after.

'''Kiana:''' …The Selene?

'''Bronya:''' Kiana, the Doctors will explain later. For now, let’s follow the Principal’s plan.

'''Kiana:''' Yeah, you’re right. We need to hurry things up.

'''Theresa:''' …The front line is in position. Dr. Tesla, how are things on your end?

'''Tesla:''' Testing fire power at 20%, according to Einstein’s plan. The Selene is ready to be activated.

'''Theresa:''' Okay, Kiana? Have you retreated into position?

'''Kiana:''' We’ve gotten to a safe location.

'''Theresa:''' Copy.

'''Theresa:''' Dr. Tesla, we’re good to go.

'''Tesla:''' Roger.

'''Tesla:''' Hyperion Shipborne Anti-Herrscher Arm, Main Gun: Selene… Activate!

As the Selene unfolded, the Hyperion began to make the sound of focusing energy, like thousands of turbines turning at the same time.

'''Einstein:''' System control, ready.

'''Tesla:''' Output control, ready.

'''Einstein:''' Orbit control, ready.

'''Tesla:''' Target locked!

'''Einstein:''' Commencing range corrections. Correction complete.

'''Tesla:''' Selene… Fire!

A beam of white light struck the light curtain. With a loud bang, a clear hole appeared.

'''Tesla:''' …Great, we did it!

'''Theresa:''' Kiana, how are things on your side?

'''Kiana:''' No problems here, we can clearly see the hole in the light curtain!

'''Tesla:''' Great, then we’ll prepare a more powerful…

'''Bronya:''' Wait, Dr. Tesla, something’s wrong!

'''Tesla:''' What’s wrong?

'''Kiana:''' The light curtain… it just instantly repaired itself.

'''Theresa:''' What? Repaired?!

'''Tesla:''' Ugh, I knew it wouldn’t be that easy!

'''Tesla:''' So that jerk not only put up this annoying barrier, but even found a way to make sure it stayed repaired! Or… is this also part of his “power”?

'''Tesla:''' Mophead…. And you, Nagamitsu - were you able to calculate the light curtain’s threshold based on that test shot?

'''Einstein:''' Of course, Dr. Tesla. We have good news and bad news.

'''Tesla:''' What? Quit beating around the bush and just tell us!

'''Einstein:''' The good news is that the Selene’s attack worked and we were able to get an exact energy threshold reading.

'''Einstein:''' The bad news is that the threshold is so high, that even with all of the Hyperion’s remaining energy, we still wouldn’t be able to completely destroy the light curtain.

'''Nagamitsu:''' And if the light curtain is not completely destroyed, it will regenerate itself, just as Kiana saw.

'''Tesla:''' What? I thought we were able to breach it with just 20% of the energy!

'''Einstein:''' But even with 4 times as much energy, we’d only make a bigger hole. It isn’t enough to keep up with its self-fixing.

'''Einstein:''' …Let alone destroy it completely.

'''Nagamitsu:''' To completely destroy the light curtain, we need to use at least 5 times the amount of all Honkai energy stored in the Hyperion, all at the same time.

'''Einstein:''' Which is to say nothing about how we’re going to concentrate that much energy into the Hyperion at once in the first place…

'''Einstein:''' The power required by that theoretical value exceeds the maximum power that the Selene can fire at.

'''Kiana:''' In other words, the plan to use the Selene… isn’t really feasible?

'''Einstein:''' I’m sorry. I have to admit…

'''Bronya:''' Wait, Dr. Einstein!

'''Bronya:''' Perhaps… everything you just said was good news.

'''Tesla:''' …What? What are you talking about? You expect us to just conjure up a few more Selenes?

'''Bronya:''' Yes, exactly.

'''Tesla:''' What? Are you serious? Wait a minute, are you saying…

'''Bronya:''' You got it… I say we use the power of the Herrscher of Reason to construct an array of Selenes with sufficient power.

'''Seele:''' Huh?!

'''Theresa:''' What?!

'''Kiana:''' Is that… even possible?

'''Bronya:''' Of course it will be difficult. After all, this is something that even Mr. Yang has never done.

'''Bronya:''' But… it’s worth trying.

'''Bronya:''' …Bronya, have faith in yourself.

…A few months ago.

'''Welt:''' …He was a survivor of the 1st Eruption. At that time, Berlin was in shambles. Schicksal found him at the epicenter.

'''Welt:''' That’s right, he was the previous “Welt”, the first Herrscher of Reason.

When the man beside her shared this story, Bronya noticed he sounded a bit tired.

Back then, things like “Herrscher of Reason” and “Welt” seemed distant to Bronya.

The Core wasn’t a part of her story yet, nor the figures in her dreams a part of her experience…

That was a name that carried a lot of hope, but it was not Bronya’s.

'''Welt:''' Bronya, maybe you misunderstood. I have often said that “Herrscher of Reason” represents more than just a power…

'''Welt:''' This also means… that the potential that can be unleashed by the “Herrscher of Reason” is far beyond what I am now able to control.

'''Bronya:''' …?

'''Welt:''' “Herrscher of Reason” represents a sort of conviction; a conviction that “humanity can fight against the Honkai”, that “humanity can rebel against the gods”.

'''Welt:''' The reason why the first Herrscher of Reason chose to fight for humanity…

'''Welt:''' Was because he retained his consciousness as a human, while taking on the thoughts of the 300,000 people in the Core.

'''Bronya:''' The thoughts of 300,000 people… It must’ve been a huge burden on his mind.

'''Welt:''' Maybe. But that’s what a real Herrscher of Reason would do.

'''Welt:''' We have never forgotten that we are human. We have always carried humanity’s pain and fought against humanity’s enemies.

'''Welt:''' It represents the history that human beings have gone through, and its power comes from human civilisation.

'''Welt:''' Now it’s in your hands, Bronya.

'''Welt:''' It’s something so heavy that even I can’t use the full power of a “Herrscher”.

'''Welt:''' Yet so light that it’s sleeping peacefully within your body at this moment, without causing any rejection.

'''Bronya:''' …

'''Welt:''' Of course, I’m not forcing you to accept anything.

'''Welt:''' I’m just explaining to you the history of the “Herrscher of Reason” and those figures in your dream.

'''Welt:''' After all, I believe… you can do better than me, Bronya.

'''Welt:''' Your Honkai adaptability is stronger than mine, and you have more combat experience and skills than I did when I first became the Herrscher of Reason.

'''Welt:''' The only time I successfully merged with the minds of those 300,000 people was when I rebuilt my last body after the 2nd Eruption.

'''Bronya:''' Rebuilt your body…

'''Bronya:''' (…His last body?)

'''Welt:''' Haha, at the time, I thought it wasn’t possible either.

'''Welt:''' How can someone fully understand the structure and state of every cell in the human body?

'''Welt:''' But when I faced the 300,000 people in the Core and became determined to recover my body to continue my fight for humanity… the Core’s power helped me.

'''Welt:''' 300,000 thoughts poured into me all at once, squeezing and tearing at each other. They almost shattered my very consciousness.

'''Welt:''' But in the end, I succeeded in restoring my human body from nothing. That was the only time I fully unlocked the power of the Herrscher of Reason.

'''Welt:''' The burden of that spiritual harmony was so great that when I tried to reshape my body again in the Sea of Quanta and fought back against Kevin…

'''Welt:''' The Core itself stopped me from doing the same thing twice. Though I managed to recover at just the right moment by reading the construction’s memory…

'''Welt:''' But now this body has adapted to the Herrscher Core… as you can see.

'''Bronya:''' …

'''Welt:''' But I believe your situation is completely different, Bronya.

'''Welt:''' Not only because you have far more talent than me, but also because you have the same light in your eyes… as Welt Joyce once had.

'''Welt:''' You’ve never met him… but I promise you, you both are very alike.

'''Theresa:''' Bronya, maybe we should consider other plans…

'''Bronya:''' Don’t worry, Principal. I know what I’m doing.

'''Kiana:''' …Will she really make it?

'''Bronya:''' Don’t be silly. Haven’t you done something similar? If you’ve done it, why can’t I?

'''Kiana:''' Okay… I trust you, Bronya.

'''Einstein:''' …

'''Einstein:''' I understand. Bronya, I will leave it to you.

'''Tesla:''' We’ll charge the Selene on the Hyperion for the second and last time. Then we’ll attack on your command.

'''Tesla:''' After all, if we have to do this…

'''Einstein:''' …Everyone with Anti-Entropy must be worthy of believing in, Herrscher of Reason.

'''Bronya:''' …I see.

'''Bronya:''' Kiana, Seele, Roza, and Lili. Please cover Bronya’s back…

'''Bronya:''' There’s a lot going on with this construction. Don’t interrupt me for any reason.

'''Kiana:''' Got it.

'''Seele:''' Leave it to Seele!

'''Bronya:''' …I believe in you all.

'''Bronya:''' Not unlike before, whether we’re completely activating a Herrscher Core or using the Selene, a large amount of Honkai energy is needed.

'''Bronya:''' I will give instructions to everyone in turn. I hope you can lend me as much power as possible.

'''Kiana:''' Understood.

'''Seele:''' Understood!

'''Rozaliya:''' Lili… what are the others talking about? I don’t understand. What is this Selene and its construction?

'''Liliya:''' Lili… is not sure. But in short, we need to protect Bronya.

'''Rozaliya:''' Oh, I get it!

'''Bronya:''' …Pff.

'''Bronya:''' Then…

'''Bronya:''' Off to battle!

--

====<u>Gameplay 28-3 - Herrscher of Reason 100%</u>====
'''Kiana:''' Hmph… Don’t even think about getting in Bronya’s way!

'''Bronya:''' …

'''Kiana:''' Bronya!

'''Bronya:''' Kiana! Now!

'''Kiana:''' Here you are, Bronya. Let’s show that jerk we mean business!

'''Seele:''' I will protect Bronya.

'''Bronya:''' …

'''Seele:''' Out of my way!

'''Bronya:''' Seele! Please!

'''Seele:''' Alright, Bronya!

'''Seele:''' Please, Bronya. I know you will succeed!

'''Seele:''' Hmph, don’t waste our time.

'''Rozaliya:''' Don’t come near Bronya!

'''Liliya:''' Liliya, give it your all!

'''Bronya:''' …

'''Rozaliya:''' Bronya!

'''Liliya:''' Watch your side, Rozaliya.

'''Bronya:''' One more left…

Rozaliya and '''Liliya:''' Leave it to us!

'''Rozaliya:''' I know it’s not a lot, but I hope it can help you out!

'''Liliya:''' This is… Liliya’s total strength.

…

As the Core of Reason gradually filled with external energy, Bronya began to feel that her spirit was merging into the depths of the Core.

She knew that as long as she stayed in this state, she’d be able to sense that place…

'''Bronya:''' …

Bronya was here again, in this dreamland of scorched earth. But this time… she already knew who the figure was in front of her.

He was the first Herrscher of Reason, the hero who saved New York, who once made the Tyrant Above watch the stars crumble.

His name was Welt Joyce.

Their name was Welt Joyce.

'''Bronya:''' (The thoughts of 300,000 people… I see now.)

Bronya noticed that… those who were walking on this scorched earth were both shadows and not shadows, both fragments and not fragments.

They were the thoughts of the 300,000 people that formed this unique Core.

It was this unique Core that allowed the thoughts of 300,000 people to be passed on to this day.

Not one of them was the “Herrscher of Reason”.

And yet all of them were the “Herrscher of Reason”.

Involuntarily, Bronya approached the leading man step by step.

“A kid like us?”

“Another Honkai victim?”

“Ah, we’re from the same hometown.”

“Is she the next Herrscher of Reason?”

“Is she the one to carry on our name?”

Countless thoughts whispered in her ear with every step she took.

Bronya knew that the Core itself was questioning her, checking whether she really was qualified to be next in line.

'''Bronya:''' …

Finally, she stood in front of him.

It was the first time she faced him in the Core at such a close distance.

That “Sovereign” must have faced him like this before.

What was in Welt Yang’s mind at that time?

And before that… when “He” was here treading this scorched earth, what was in his mind then?

“The warrior to take on the Honkai.”

“At so young an age?”

“Her will is strong.”

“But she’s also immature.”

'''Bronya:''' …

The thoughts were still whispering.

Bronya’s attention returned to “Him”.

She sensed the tenderness in “His” eyes, and the stubbornness beneath that tenderness.

She finally realised something.

The legendary hero was just an ordinary boy.

She had seen that sort of ordinary many times before in Seele…

And she understood better than anyone else that it was this ordinary that gave Seele her unparalleled tenderness and strength.

This time, she felt she finally understood the meaning of his name - Welt.

'''Bronya:''' I know you’re in doubt and I know why.

'''Bronya:''' Yes, the Bronya once refused to inherit the name of “Welt”, thinking that she could not take on the responsibility of protecting the world.

'''Bronya:''' But now, I have come to understand…

'''Bronya:''' That this so-called “world” is not a cold concept, nor a word that only exists in slogans.

'''Bronya:''' Everyone builds their own unique world. These worlds will merge with the worlds of those around them, and create a larger world.

'''Bronya:''' And the world represented by Welt is the result of repeating this process tens of billions of times.

'''Bronya:''' No one has ever been able to take on the responsibility of protecting the world.

'''Bronya:''' But everyone can have the desire to protect the world.

'''Bronya:''' The desire to protect the people we want to protect, the desire to open up the future we want to go to… the desire to compromise, struggle, let go, or insist…

'''Bronya:''' These complex human natures are in everyone’s heart. And when they blend together… all of us will get the proof of why we are human.

'''Bronya:''' “Welt” is just a name. “Bronya” is just an ordinary human being.

'''Bronya:''' Whether I inherit that name or not, the Bronya will continue on the path that has been opened up by her predecessors.

'''Bronya:''' No matter how much strength she has, the Bronya will use it to protect the world where everyone lives.

'''Bronya:''' The Bronya… will always choose to become the Herrscher of Reason as a human… and as a small cornerstone protecting the world!

'''Welt Joyce:''' …

The gentle but determined boy didn’t speak. He just quietly watched Bronya, and listened to her speak her heart.

His eyes were saying…

“We knew from the beginning that you would get to this point.”

“She has hesitated before.”

“But she has conquered her doubts.”

“She was afraid.”

“But she has conquered her fears.”

“Maybe she really can bring hope to humanity…”

“At the very least, she deserves to be the next Herrscher of Reason.”

“Her will has become resolute and mature.”

“Well then, we must do everything in our power… to help her.”

“To neither give in to the Honkai, nor kowtow to the gods. This is our unanimous thought.”

“Nothing more can be said. She… is ready.”

'''Bronya:''' …

'''Bronya:''' Yes. The Bronya is ready now.

'''Bronya:''' The 300,000 thoughts… Bronya is ready to bear them all.

'''Bronya:''' Spiritual harmony, begin!

In an instant, countless soul fragments poured into Bronya’s consciousness.

These souls had traveled different paths, hesitated at different points.

But they finally made the same decision as Bronya. They decided to protect this world that belongs to human beings.

It was this decision that made their fate and Bronya’s fate intertwined at this moment.

'''Bronya:''' Ugh…

The thoughts of 300,000 people poured into her along with their traits. Some of them were determined, some brave, some cautious, others immature…

And Bronya also felt the power that her companions had given her before.

Roza and Lili’s power was as lively and mischievous as the waves. It felt immature but reliable.

Seele’s power was easy to identify. It was as blue and clear as the sky, both gentle and tolerant at the same time.

Kiana’s strength was as warm as the sun, yet illuminating the way forward like the moon. She had always led everyone like this.

There were also thousands of thoughts and thousands of ideas, which overwhelmed Bronya’s spirit and tore at her soul.

'''Bronya:''' Ugh…

Words flashed across her mind.

“Human”, “Herrscher”, “Honkai”, “Civilisation”.

“Peace”, “War”, “Violence”, “Warmth”.

The spiritual pain didn’t last as long as she had expected. She gradually grasped the waves of thoughts, learning to stay afloat as though she were surfing them.

She understood that it was the precipitation of these millions of beliefs, the deposition of these millions of years, now gathered into a fervent and pure conviction…

“Human beings will change the world with our own will.”

The power of the Herrscher of Reason rapidly spread to the other side of the singularity at a speed that Bronya couldn’t fathom.

Even if it was a weapon that she had only looked at a few times.

Even if it was a device whose principles were not fully understood.

…The complete power of the Herrscher didn’t care about these, as long as the target was within the reach of mortals.

Any miracle that civilisation could achieve, any height civilisation could reach… the Herrscher of Reason could make it reappear in an instant.

'''Bronya:''' One person’s strength might not be enough.

'''Bronya:''' Even the thoughts of 300,000 might not be enough.

'''Bronya:''' But at this moment, the Bronya is the real Herrscher of Reason…

'''Bronya:''' Representing human civilisation, the Bronya will challenge the Honkai!

'''Bronya:''' Selene, 6x power… constructing.

''[CG plays wherein Bronya constructs a total of 6 separate Selenes, all firing a concentrated shot at one point of the light curtain:''

'''''Bronya:''' Fire!'']

A loud noise shook the earth.

Under the combined impact of the two kinds of energy from the Herrscher of Reason and the Hyperion, the light curtain shattered in an instant with no signs of recovery.

'''Kiana:''' …We did it!

'''Bronya:''' …

'''Seele:''' Bronya!!

--

====<u>Gameplay 28-4 - Strange Grace</u>====
'''Seele:''' Bronya!!

'''Bronya:''' …

Bronya lost consciousness. She created the Selene out of thin air… After doing what no other Herrscher of Reason had done, she was completely exhausted.

Seele felt that Bronya had almost no breath in her arms, as if the latter’s soul could dissipate at any time.

'''Seele:''' Bronya, Bronya!

'''Kiana:''' Bronya! Hold on!

'''Rozaliya:''' What should we do… Is Bronya going to die?!

'''Liliya:''' Don’t say that, Roza!

'''Seele:''' …Is there anything we can do?

'''Seele:''' Wait… Seele, leave her to me!

'''Seele:''' Isn’t there something nearby that could save Bronya’s life?!

'''Seele:''' Huh?

'''Seele:''' That’s…

'''Seele:''' …The Abyss Flower?

'''Seele:''' But… other issues aside… we don’t know how to use it at all!

'''Seele:''' …It’s okay, Seele. Trust me.

'''Seele:''' Are you sure… you can control it?

'''Seele:''' Somehow, I feel familiar with this weapon. Maybe my power resonates with it somehow.

'''Seele:''' I think… maybe I’ve known how to use it all along.

'''Seele:''' …I see.

'''Seele:''' But allow me to do it with you.

'''Seele:''' …Is this really the time for that?!

'''Seele:''' No… I mean, I can feel that…

'''Seele:''' Are you trying to show off?

'''Seele:''' …Huh?!

'''Seele:''' Even if you do know how to use its power, you don’t know how to properly wield it yet…

'''Seele:''' …And you don’t know if your strength alone is enough to save Bronya.

'''Seele:''' Tsk, tsk.

'''Seele:''' So please, let me help. Let’s save Bronya together.

'''Seele:''' …

'''Seele:''' Ugh, alright.

'''Seele:''' Listen, I’ll try to draw out the unique power of this weapon… You need to follow me and feel that power, then lead it to Bronya.

'''Seele:''' No problem, I’ll try my best.

'''Seele:''' …

'''Seele:''' Okay, I’m going to start.

The girl closed her eyes and followed the guidance of the other voice in her heart…

She felt Bronya’s vitality in her arms and noticed a strange but familiar power nearby.

She weaved her power into a thread that connects the two.

'''Seele:''' (Please… It has to work!)

''[CG plays wherein both Seeles wield and channel the powers of the 9th Divine Key, Abyss Flower:''

'''''Seele:''' Now then…''

'''''Seele:''' Please, the other me!'']

'''Seele:''' Did it work…?

'''Bronya:''' Ugh…

'''Seele:''' Bronya…!

'''Bronya:''' Seele…?

'''Bronya:''' …

Bronya lost consciousness once again.

But Seele sensed that… it was just drowsiness caused by excessive fatigue.

'''Seele:''' I’m so glad… Bronya, you’re alright…

'''Seele:''' Thank you, Seele…

…

'''Seele:''' …?

'''Seele:''' Seele…?

…

The girl couldn't hear her own inner answer for a long time.

'''Seele:''' …?!

'''Seele:''' Other me? Are you alright?! Other me?!

…

…

'''Seele:''' …Tsk, tsk.

'''Seele:''' You’re being annoying. I’m fine.

'''Seele:''' Oh… You scared me…

'''Seele:''' …Somehow, I’m also tired.

'''Seele:''' This Abyss Flower consumes… life force, right? Anyway, it’s not quite as taxing as I had imagined.

'''Seele:''' Still…

'''Seele:''' By the way, you were worried, right?

'''Seele:''' Of course! Don’t scare me like that again!

'''Seele:''' (Wait, she admitted it? What should I say now?)

'''Seele:''' …Do you hear me, Seele?

'''Seele:''' …Alright, I’m the obedient Seele, I’ll do whatever you-

'''Kiana:''' …?!!

'''Kiana:''' Wait… What is that?!

''[CG plays wherein what appears to be the result of the Oath of Judah’s Zeroth Power, Elysion Pedion, starts manifesting in the sky.'']

'''Tesla:''' …Hey, Mophead, is this a joke? Tell me that’s not the thing we saw in the 2nd Eruption!

'''Einstein:''' Judging from the energy readings and monitoring responses… it is indeed Elysion Pedion.

'''Einstein:''' No, to be more accurate, it’s the power of Binding being used in a way similar to Elysion Pedion.

'''Tesla:''' Kiana! Get everyone out of there! If we get hit by those gears, it’s all over!

'''Tesla:''' We don’t know if it’s a defensive measure triggered by breaking the light curtain or what, but it’s rapidly spreading out with the Imaginary Seed as its core!

'''Kiana:''' …!

'''Kiana:''' Seele, Roza, Lili! Can you move?

'''Rozaliya:''' Huff… Huff…

Roza could barely support her body with her greatsword.

'''Rozaliya:''' I gave all my power to Bronya just now… and I don’t have much strength left…

'''Rozaliya:''' Lili has fallen asleep. I can barely carry her on my back… but Seele and Bronya…

In Seele’s arms, Bronya was breathing steadily, but still showed no signs of regaining consciousness.

'''Seele:''' Huff… Huff…

'''Seele:''' It’s okay… I… can carry Bronya…

'''Kiana:''' (What should I do…)

'''Kiana:''' (Everyone looks incapacitated, but the gars aren’t slowing down at all…)

'''Kiana:''' (Is there any way to deflect them…?)

Kiana tried to hold the greatsword in her hands, but her power was still out of control…

'''Kiana:''' (Shoot… my power still hasn’t recovered!)

Everyone was silent for a while, the twisted gears rapidly expanding and drawing near.

…All of a sudden, a roar pierced the air.

'''Tesla:''' That’s… the assault ship on the Hyperion?! Theresa? When did you go out?

'''Einstein:''' This is good. Now that you’re already here, Theresa, let the ground combatants board the assault ship as soon as possible and retreat.

'''Theresa:''' No… Doctor.

'''Theresa:''' Retreating won’t work.

'''Tesla:''' …Theresa?

'''Theresa:''' Bronya and the others just got through a fight, and now they’re exhausted.

'''Theresa:''' Considering the speed these gears are expanding at… I’m afraid it’s risky if we retreat from the air.

'''Einstein:''' …

'''Theresa:''' Doctor, do you remember that experiment we did about the power of Binding?

'''Tesla:''' You… You mean…

'''Theresa:''' You guys have probably thought about it too. If I use Elysion Pedion to output the same Binding power… Kiana and the others… will be safe.

'''Tesla:''' Wait, Theresa. Theoretically, it could work, but…

'''Einstein:''' Madam Theresa, you should know what Elysion Pedion means to you as a MANTIS.

'''Theresa:''' I know. I experienced it during the 2nd Eruption.

'''Tesla:''' Come on, didn’t you see that Imaginary Seed? To match that thing’s strength…

'''Tesla:''' You’ll die!

'''Theresa:''' …Maybe.

'''Einstein:''' …

'''Einstein:''' When the field is deployed, the ship engine powered by Honkai energy will also stop running. Even we can’t remotely control it from the Hyperion.

'''Theresa:''' I know.

'''Tesla:''' …

'''Einstein:''' Looks like we can’t stop you.

'''Theresa:''' Thank you for your understanding, Doctor.

'''Theresa:''' …

The assault ship soared higher toward the Imaginary Seed. The radio signal grew weaker until it disappeared.

It was so quiet around here, only a monotonous mechanical hum could be heard…

2000, Schicksal HQ.

'''Cecilia:''' Thank you for accompanying us to take Kiana’s art photos, Theresa.

'''Cecilia:''' She likes you very much.

The last time I had a good chat with her was a peaceful afternoon.

Sitting on the bench, they watched a father and daughter playing together in the distance and chatted for a while.

'''Theresa:''' Cecilia, your application to the Far East School Program you applied to has been approved.

'''Cecilia:''' Really? That’s great.

'''Theresa:''' But be more diligent when you go through the process next time… this time, you didn’t indicate the priority of the program on the files.

'''Theresa:''' Luckily, I happen to be a cautious person. Otherwise, who knows how long they’d have stayed in that stack of files?

'''Cecilia:''' Hehe, thank you, Theresa. I feel that you care about this program a lot.

'''Theresa:''' Of course. It’s your dream, isn’t it?

'''Theresa:''' Kiana is growing up every day… If we don’t hurry up, she’ll be too old for that school.

'''Cecilia:''' Then help me realise another dream, okay? About last time’s proposal…

'''Cecilia:''' Do you want to be a teacher in my school, Theresa?

'''Theresa:''' Eh, forget it. I can’t be a teacher.

'''Cecilia:''' Huh? Why not?

'''Theresa:''' I’m not good at dealing with kids. They won’t see me as a teacher.

'''Cecilia:''' Is that so? I think you’ll be fine. Kiana likes you.

'''Theresa:''' I’d better stay at this HQ. You’ll find better teachers, and…

'''Theresa:''' I have a hunch that your daughter will be a bit more trouble than the other kids. I can’t handle her.

'''Cecilia:''' Ah, thanks for the compliment.

'''Theresa:''' It’s not a compliment.

'''Cecilia:''' But maybe she’ll be well-behaved when she grows up, just like her dad.

'''Theresa:''' …Siegfried is not well-behaved at all!

The two kept joking with each other.

'''Theresa:''' …

'''Theresa:''' But Cecilia, why did you rush to build a “Valkyrie school?” Is it for Kiana?

'''Cecilia:''' Ah… no. To be honest, I’d be glad if she didn’t want to be a Valkyrie in the future.

'''Cecilia:''' To be honest… I’ve thought about building a school for a long time now.

'''Theresa:''' A long time?

'''Cecilia:''' After all… as you know, I’ve been training as a Valkyrie since a very young age. I knew almost nothing about the world other than fighting the Honkai.

'''Cecilia:''' Until I met Siegfried… You know what happened when we first met.

'''Cecilia:''' At that time, I finally realised… we could experience so much more than just fighting! Those experiences became a new driving force for my Valkyrie career.

'''Cecilia:''' That’s the reason why I want to create a different branch. I want to give those students something I almost missed.

'''Cecilia:''' A room with privacy, a beautiful garden, a delicious school cafeteria; lessons, activities, friends who you can skip school with together…

'''Cecilia:''' I want them to experience the world freely as a person before becoming a Valkyrie.

'''Theresa:''' …I see.

'''Cecilia:''' Well, are you moved at all? The faculty can also enjoy what I mentioned above.

'''Theresa:''' I’m not so simple-minded…

'''Theresa:''' Still, a campus full of youth… Sounds like your style.

'''Cecilia:''' Oh, yes! Speaking of youth… the school has to have a big swimming pool!

'''Theresa:''' You could build it by the sea or on an island. Everyone could spend summer hanging out.

'''Cecilia:''' Yeah! They’ll play outside and have claw machines, an arcade, and an amusement park! I used to enjoy arcades!

'''Theresa:''' …They wouldn’t want to study anymore.

'''Cecilia:''' Huh, you think so?

'''Theresa:''' Maybe think about only opening them on weekends.

'''Cecilia:''' Haha, that’s more reasonable.

'''Cecilia:''' …I just want them to have their own lives, a life that has nothing to do with their career or responsibilities, a life where they can wholeheartedly make themselves happier.

'''Cecilia:''' Even as Valkyries, I want them to see things for themselves, experiencing the world at their own pace.

'''Cecilia:''' I hope that one day they will be able to decide their own destiny and choose what they want to protect.

'''Cecilia:''' I hope they’ll have beautiful memories in mind when they cry out “fight for all that’s beautiful in this world”. I hope they truly understand what that means.

'''Theresa:''' …And what we need to do is witness and protect them all.

'''Cecilia:''' Yes, you’re right.

'''Cecilia:''' Theresa, it’s okay if you don’t want to be a teacher.

'''Theresa:''' Why bring that up again?

'''Cecilia:''' But I hope that once in a while, you’ll come by to see Kiana and her classmates at school.

'''Cecilia:''' I’m sure you’ll be in for a surprise.

'''Theresa:''' Haha, then I’ll be looking forward to it.

'''Theresa:''' Speaking of which, for a unique school like this, it may not be appropriate to call it “Far East School”. Why not consider using another name?

'''Cecilia:''' Ah, you’re right…

'''Cecilia:''' What should we call it?

'''Theresa:''' Well, we need to think about that.

'''Cecilia:''' How about “St. Freya”? It stands for “youth”…

'''Theresa:''' …

'''Theresa:''' …It’s just like you said, Cecilia.

'''Theresa:''' The students of “St. Freya” have grown so much, we can’t even believe it.

'''Theresa:''' They can now decide their own destiny, choose what they want to protect, and they will never stop going forward, even if they are far apart from each other.

'''Theresa:''' Although… students of St. Freya do cause all sorts of trouble… But you’re right, Cecilia.

'''Theresa:''' This is the “future” that is different from ours.

'''Theresa:''' This is… the “future” we should protect.

'''Theresa:''' …

Theresa took a deep breath.

'''Theresa:''' Judah, my old friend, you have always been all-powerful. So please…

'''Theresa:''' Help me one last time.

''[CG plays wherein Theresa activates the Oath of Judah’s Zeroth Power, Elysion Pedion:''

'''''Theresa:''' Oath of Judah, Level 0 output!''

'''''Theresa:''' Elysion Pedion, directional expansion!'']

It happened in an instant.

The Divine Key hit the Imaginary Seed accurately. The chain reaction made all the gears covering the sky lose their power.

They broke, dissipated, and collapsed…

The power of Binding had no effect. Otto’s church was no longer guarded by any barriers.

Theresa Apocalypse had achieved the expected victory…

…And paid the expected price.

…

…What happened? Did it work?

The Imaginary Seed was broken, and the gears in the sky were fading away. The power of Binding was gone.

Wonderful…

Her vision began to blur, and the sound of wind in her ears gradually faded away.

She wanted to speak, but her lips… No, her entire body had no consciousness at all.

Am I… falling?

She could no longer feel the wind. The gears that grew farther and farther and the strands of hair brushing in her vision reminded herself of that fact.

Kiana… Bronya…

I’m glad that… you’re alright…

…

…What is that?

A holy white light shot down from the sky. It didn’t feel threatening… but rather, reassuring.light

In Theresa’s memory, she had only seen such holy light in one person.

'''Theresa:''' Cecilia…

After saying the name in her head, Theresa lost all her strength.

She closed her eyes and let herself fall into unconsciousness…

And fall…

===Act 2 - Beyond the Equinox===

====<u>Gameplay 28-5 - Drifter</u>====
'''???:''' 17 years and 8 months.

'''???:''' Compared to 50,000 years, this was just a short moment.

'''???:''' As I have been forced to work again, let's do things by routine…

'''???:''' Tell each visitor what kind of power they have inherited.

'''???:''' Then, inscribe in their souls the promise that once belonged to “Him”.

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' …?

'''???:''' What’s going on? Why isn’t the revelation of Stigmata forming normally?

'''???:''' …That person isn’t a part of “Them”, are they?

'''???:''' No, that’s impossible…

Imaginary Space.

The origin of the universe, where the laws converge.

The meaning of time here cannot be understood based on common sense, and the operation of things here cannot be calculated by the study of mechanics.

For mere mortals, without special precautions, it’s almost impossible to sustain an existence here…

…But this girl was an exception.

Not long ago, she went deep into the hinterlands of Imaginary Space and escaped successfully with the support of her friends.

The Seed of Sumeru faithfully kept record of that precious experience for her. The girl found returning from Imaginary Space back to reality not all that difficult.

She was not wrong about her own strength… but at that point she had encountered some unexpected problems.

'''???:''' ▉▉▉▉▉▉, ▉▉▉.

'''Durandal:''' (What’s that sound… in my head?)

'''???:''' ▉▉▉, ▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉▉.

'''Durandal:''' (…Everything is muffled.)

'''Durandal:''' (Strange. Is that noise… some kind of entanglement phenomenon here in Imaginary Space?)

'''???:''' ▉▉, ▉▉▉▉▉…

'''???:''' ▉▉▉▉▉▉▉, ▉▉, ▉▉▉▉▉▉▉!

Unknown noises rippled through the void.

The ripples overlaid each other to reveal the real spatial structure and drew the girl in…

'''Durandal:''' …!

'''Durandal:''' Although I have passed through absolute nothingness, I clearly haven’t returned to the inner parts of the Seed of Sumeru.

'''Durandal:''' The Genius’ signal is very unstable and cannot be used for communication and precise positioning. Is it because of the noise just now? Or…

'''Durandal:''' Anyway, let’s sort things out.

'''Durandal:''' In the previous battle with the Overseer, I defeated him momentarily, but he also found an opportunity to exile me to Imaginary Space.

'''Durandal:''' And this place seems to be part of Imaginary Space.

'''Durandal:''' That space ability the Overseer used… did it come from the Cosmic Juggernaut? Did he choose a place to exile me to at random, or did he purposefully choose this place?

'''Durandal:''' …No, it’s not the time to think about these questions.

'''Durandal:''' Whatever his methods and goals, I should go back to the outside world as soon as possible. I can’t solve anything just by standing here and thinking.

'''Durandal:''' …At least the Genius can point me in some direction. Let’s head that way and see what clues we can find.

'''Durandal:''' The Astral Harness’ power isn’t stable here… gotta be careful.

'''Durandal:''' The illuminated point turned into… bottled notes?

'''Durandal:''' Is this some sort of illusion?

Durandal pulled the cork off the bottled notes and took them out. They were incomplete, seemingly torn from a notebook.

'''Paper Slip:''' This is indeed a unique dimension of Imaginary Space.

'''Paper Slip:''' Neverending history… seems to take on some weird forms in your subconscious.

'''Paper Slip:''' Anyway, since I’ve been stuck here for a long time… I have to write something to maintain my sanity.

'''Paper Slip:''' I noticed… something strange that wasn’t supposed to be here. Maybe that’s how some that have lost their essence look like to me.

'''Paper Slip:''' …Perhaps what I’m doing now is just a hopeless gamble. But one has to try.

'''Durandal:''' (…These are some vague clues. The person who left the note seemed to have encountered something that was difficult to resolve.)

'''Durandal:''' (At least it’s something. Let’s keep looking in the direction the Genius pointed in.)

'''Durandal:''' Of course. The illuminated point turned into… bottled notes?

Durandal picked up the second set of bottled notes and took them out.

Paper Slip” After using “the device” to travel through memories and several pieces of history, I was one step closer to being free again.

'''Paper Slip:''' But it was at that last step… that I failed. Everything went back to the beginning.

'''Paper Slip:''' Like before, I can’t harness that power at all, let alone use it to pass the trial.

'''Paper Slip:''' If you found this note, I wish you luck… Don’t wear yourself out like I did with repeated challenges.

'''Durandal:''' (The last step… Trial… Worn out?)

'''Durandal:''' (This space seems a lot more dangerous than it appears.)

'''Durandal:''' (That being said, there’s no point in stopping. Let’s keep going in the direction the Genius pointed to.)

Durandal opened the third set of bottled notes that was transformed by light.

'''Paper Slip:''' Although for me this is the 28th challenge… the judge of the trial won’t admit it at all.

'''Paper Slip:''' Does it have no understanding of this? Or…

'''Paper Slip:''' Am I worn out to the point… where others have trouble recognising me?

'''Paper Slip:''' …Did I have a name before?

'''Paper Slip:''' Forget it. I’m trapped here, I have nothing to lose.

'''Durandal:''' (…)

'''Durandal:''' (So this is what it means to be “worn out”. Is it because he had been trapped for too long, or…)

'''Durandal:''' No, I can’t make an effective judgment based on just these notes. Let’s continue to look for a breakthrough in the direction that the Genius pointed to.)

'''Durandal:''' (What is this flower-like thing…)

The Genius’ indicator vibrated as Durandal approached it.

'''Durandal:''' (Is this the device mentioned in those bottled notes? Doesn’t look like it at all.)

'''Durandal:''' (According to that person, I should use it to gradually approach the final “Adjudicator”.)

'''Durandal:''' (Is there any clue here…)

Durandal found a broken photo in the sand underfoot.

'''Durandal:''' (It’s… a photo taken at HOMU World or somewhere similar.)

'''Durandal:''' (Can’t find anything that can be used as a clue on it…)

'''Durandal:''' (…Let’s put it away for now.)

'''Durandal:''' Looks like there’s no other clues around here… I should get ready to find a way to activate “the device”.

Unlike the spacetime projector in Klostern, the “device” here did not change the surrounding environment, but projected people into other spaces.

It was dream-like.

That was the actual past, the shadow left in time by history.

'''Bianka:''' (Um… I’m hungry.)

'''Bianka:''' (It’s so bright outside… why didn’t anyone wake me up…)

'''Bianka:''' …Ah.

'''Bianka:''' Right, this is a nursing home. Why did I think that someone would wake me up?

'''Bianka:''' …

'''Bianka:''' (Last month… I picked my name and birthday here.)

'''Bianka:''' (They said my head had been so badly injured that I had to go through an operation.)

'''Bianka:''' (But the cost was… losing any memory before coming here, forever.)

'''Bianka:''' Forget it, there’s no point in dwelling on what’s been lost!

'''Bianka:''' Although I had a lazy morning, it’s important to do some exercise everyday.

'''Bianka:''' …Jog 5 laps around the nursing home, then do 50 push-ups and 30 pull-ups!

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' Sochi’s sanatorium… I sure do miss it.

'''Durandal:''' But… a real sanatorium would never have this…

'''Durandal:''' I’ll go check it out.

'''Huge Doll:''' …

'''Durandal:''' Hi.

'''Huge Doll:''' …

'''Durandal:''' Hello!

'''Huge Doll:''' …

'''Durandal:''' …Hey.

Durandal kicked the giant doll’s rear end.

'''Huge Doll:''' Owww, that hurts… Huh? Who are you? I have a poor memory, but I’ve never seen you around here before.

'''Durandal:''' This is the first time we’ve met.

Durandal briefly introduced herself.

'''Durandal:''' So, who are you?

'''Huge Doll:''' Me? I guess I’m… a consciousness that forgot its own name and face. What do I look like to you?

'''Durandal:''' …Like a giant doll.

'''Huge Doll:''' Doll? Let me guess… Am I HOMU? No, perhaps HOLA? No way I’m the HOMU Emperor, right?

'''Durandal:''' Uhh… couldn’t you just look yourself?

'''Huge Doll:''' …Of course I can’t see myself.

'''Durandal:''' Can’t see yourself? You mean…

'''Huge Doll:''' Yeah. I have completely forgotten my appearance and name, and in this space, to forget means to have lost.

'''Huge Doll:''' When I look at my body… all I see is something like… a translucent figure.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Huge Doll:''' Hey, don’t make that face. Once you get used to it, it’s not so bad.

'''Huge Doll:''' Well, I got some good sleep…

The huge doll tried its best to stretch.

'''Huge Doll:''' …Tell me, why did you wake me up?

'''Durandal:''' I need to go through here.

'''Huge Doll:''' Go through? But this hall leads to nowhere.

'''Durandal:''' …What do you mean?

'''Huge Doll:''' I mean, I have never found a way that leads anywhere else. Wait…

'''Huge Doll:''' No, no. I’ve forgotten my name and appearance… so, maybe I used to know how to get in and out of this place, I just don’t remember.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Huge Doll:''' Sorry love, I can’t help you.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' This photo and these notes… Are they yours?

Durandal handed the huge doll the photo and notes she found in the desert.

The doll looked at the damage. A giant yellow doll stood out in the middle.

'''Huge Doll:''' …Do I look like this in your eyes?

'''Durandal:''' No. To be frank, you look much more worn-out than the one in the photo. After all, everything has faded to white.

'''Huge Doll:''' Well then…

'''Huge Doll:''' …Huh?

The huge doll froze when it saw the handwriting on the note.

'''Huge Doll:''' It’s true, this is… my handwriting…

'''Huge Doll:''' But I’m sorry, I really have no memory… of the experiences recorded.

'''Durandal:''' …I understand.

'''Durandal:''' It’s a bit weird to say… but I’ve lost some memories too. I know how it feels.

'''Durandal:''' Others’ comments about you, record of you, and the you that others imagine… In the end, you will feel that these are nothing but illusions.

'''Durandal:''' Unless…

'''Durandal:''' …No, I can’t jump to conclusions about things I’ve never experienced.

'''Durandal:''' Anyway, since you don’t know the way out, let’s investigate this place carefully together.

'''Durandal:''' After all, you seem to have broken through similar spaces more than once in the past.

'''Huge Doll:''' Huh… You’re right.

'''Huge Doll:''' I left those notes, so that must mean I’ve been to the deepest parts of this place by myself many times!

'''Huge Doll:''' Nice! I feel confident all of a sudden!

'''Huge Doll:''' Come on, let’s find the clues, our memories, and the way to freedom!

'''Durandal:''' Ah… Yeah, sure.

'''Durandal:''' (…His mood changes pretty fast.)

'''Durandal:''' (Anyway, let’s try to find that weird-looking device around here first.)

'''???:''' Huff… Huff…

'''???:''' MEI! Kevin is still alive!

'''???:''' He’ll be back soon. And then, you’ll be reunited.

'''???:''' …He’s still alive, that’s wonderful!

'''???:''' He is humanity’s only hope now.

'''???:''' As long as he lives, our civilization will not disappear.

'''???:''' It’s a pity that… I can’t see him again.

'''???:''' …MEI?!

'''???:''' Your condition…

'''???:''' It seems that… my body has reached its limit.

'''???:''' I can’t even see you clearly now.

'''???:''' Just now, I could barely maintain my consciousness…

'''???:''' Now my mind is clearer, but I’m afraid it’s just a flashback.

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' Thank you, Su. It’s thanks to your medicine that I can last until now.

'''???:''' I can… put together my final plan.

'''???:''' There are two letters on the table. One is for Kevin, the other is for you.

'''???:''' You know what Kevin is carrying… You can read his letter to learn about the plans and this child of ours…

A strange, warm current suddenly appeared in the depths of her memory… but disappeared quickly.

'''???:''' …However, Su, you must never let him see my letter for you.

'''???:''' I… Why?

'''???:''' Why me?

'''???:''' …You’ll know when you read it.

'''???:''' I’m sorry it has to be like this.

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' Sorry, Kevin… I told you that I had recovered and that we’d be together when you came back from the moon…

'''???:''' Did you know I was lying? But still chose to believe…

…

'''Durandal:''' (Is this… the memory of those pioneers 50,000 years ago?)

'''Durandal:''' (The Previous Era… But the consciousness of these two is unlikely to have anything to do with HOMU or “him”, who is behind everything…)

'''Huge Doll:''' …

'''Durandal:''' You will come across your own memories and the memories of others just like this, right?

'''Huge Doll:''' …Huh? Ah, it would seem so.

'''Huge Doll:''' I don’t think I’m the owner of that memory.

'''Huge Doll:''' It’s just… When that memory floods my mind, it feels so familiar.

'''Huge Doll:''' …Perhaps I once had a similar experience, back when my memory was still complete.

'''Durandal:''' Do you remember anything?

'''Huge Doll:''' No… Not exactly.

'''Huge Doll:''' Anyway, we have a good start, right? At least my instinct tells me that we’re on the right track.

'''Huge Doll:''' Okay! Let’s find the next memory!

The huge doll moved its clumsy body and squatted on the ground to start searching, as if it were looking for glass marbles for kids.

It’s hard to say if this is a good way to find memories or not…

But he seems to be working at it really hard.

'''Durandal:''' (For now… I’ll trust his instincts.)

'''???:''' …I’ll never get tired of her sleeping face.

'''???:''' Still, it’s time to wake up, Kallen…

'''???:''' …Hey!

'''???:''' Stop tickling me, Dad!

'''???:''' Oh, have you forgotten? This is how I used to wake you up when you were two or three years old.

'''???:''' Then you made me cry. Mum was so angry that she pulled you aside… Do you think no one ever told me that?

'''???:''' I-Is that so… I can’t remember…

'''???:''' Hey, forget about it. I’m finally free today, how about we go and do some morning exercise together?

'''???:''' Well… Will you teach me the real Kaslana Gun Kata?

'''???:''' Huh? Do you mean that what you learned at school is fake?

'''???:''' Well… What I learned at school is nothing compared to your 48-Form, Dad.

'''???:''' …That’s not true, Kallen. The basics are the foundation of everything. The so-called 16-Form, 24-Form and 48-Form are just their extensions.

'''???:''' If you don’t believe me… How about we try it out? I’ll only use the first three moves of the Kaslana Gun Kata, and you can use any move you want.

'''???:''' If I lose… I’ll teach you all about the Kaslana Gun Kata, okay?

'''???:''' You promise? No take-backsies?

'''???:''' Haha, sure.

…

'''Durandal:''' A new name… has appeared in this memory.

'''Huge Doll:''' Yeah. That little girl’s name is Kallen, and she’ll practice the Kaslana Gun Kata with her father.

'''Durandal:''' …Do you know anything about these two names?

'''Huge Doll:''' Not really. I can’t remember where I heard them. But… they give me a strange feeling.

'''Durandal:''' Strange feeling?

'''Huge Doll:''' How do I put it? …When I repeat “Kaslana Gun Kata” in my heart, I feel like my blood is surging.

'''Durandal:''' I see…

The girl suddenly took a step back and drew a circle around herself with her toe. Then, she performed a dazzling set of fighting moves within the small space.

'''Durandal:''' …This is the 16-Form Kaslana Gun Kata they mentioned in that memory. Does it remind you of anything?

'''Huge Doll:''' Uh… I just felt my blood surging again.

'''Huge Doll:''' Wait, what is that…

'''Durandal:''' …!

'''Durandal:''' Is that an enemy blocking the path? …What more proof do you need that we’re on the right track!

'''Durandal:''' Anyway, leave this to me.

'''Durandal:''' Huh… even though it was a bit troublesome, I guess that got resolved smoothly.

'''Durandal:''' According to my experience, a device like this should be able to take us to the next space.

'''Huge Doll:''' …Sorry, you’ve been trying hard, and I can’t recall anything valuable.

'''Durandal:''' It’s okay, you don’t have to feel stressed.

'''Durandal:''' The path we’re taking now might be one you’ve taken before

'''Durandal:''' If we follow it, even if you can’t get your memory back… I’m sure it will help you become complete again.

'''Huge Doll:''' Hmm… You’re really something else.

'''Durandal:''' Me?

'''Huge Doll:''' Yeah. I feel like you’re really good at motivating yourself and others while still staying level-headed.

'''Durandal:''' I just quoted what others have told me.

'''Durandal:''' That person said: No matter what it is, the self, the human world, or the universe, their meaning cannot be measured by results. All life in the world starts from nothing and to nothing it shall return…

'''Durandal:''' But the road under our feet will determine the meaning of our lives.

'''Durandal:''' Although it’s a pity that we forget where we came from, as long as we know where we’re going, the past will keep supporting us.

'''Huge Doll:''' You mean to focus on our steps? That’s a good goal. It’s not out of reach, but it’s also not easy.

'''Huge Doll:''' After all, there are many people who could have gone further but ended up where I’m at now.

'''Durandal:''' …What are you talking about? Life is about moving forward, right? Forgetting who you were doesn’t mean you will lose your future.

'''Durandal:''' Come on, cheer up. We need to move on.

As the girl’s consciousness sank into the depths of her memory once more, an observer in the void also began contemplating a countermeasure.

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' Well, it looks like I need to be more patient.

'''???:''' Unlike them, the Stigmatas in your body are cleverly concealed.

'''???:''' …And they were led toward different directions by different people in different ways.

'''???:''' Huh, you’re quite the favorite child… Durandal.

'''???:''' Your Overseer forced you here…

'''???:''' Perhaps, he wants to use you to let the space that has long pervaded this area regress and collapse, and open the final path for his own career?

'''???:''' But… the tragic desire contained in the Stigmata is absolute. Whoever bears it will meet their own destiny, whether they want to or not.

'''???:''' Unless…

The roar of the engine gradually stopped. In the girl’s memory, the unique cold air in the sky was stimulating the sensitive nerves of her nose.

'''Bianka:''' (These are the Floating Isles… Schicksal’s central HQ.)

'''Bianka:''' (Let’s do this, Valkyrie Admission Test! I’m ready!)

'''Bianka:''' …Uh!

'''Bianka:''' Hey! Watch your back!

'''Rita:''' Oh, sorry… Do you need any help?

'''Bianka:''' Help? Yeah, sure… I need to report to A51. Do you know the way?

'''Rita:''' …You’re here to take the Valkyrie Admission Test, right?

'''Rita:''' Turn right ahead and go straight down that corridor. You will find A51 on your left.

'''Bianka:''' …Thanks.

'''Rita:''' You’re welcome.

'''Rita:''' …

'''Rita:''' Wait.

'''Bianka:''' …What, is something wrong?

'''Rita:''' Left is this way… right’s that way. You’re going the wrong way.

'''Bianka:''' Uh… I-I know my left from my right! I’m just… looking around.

'''Rita:''' Pff. If you don’t mind, I’ll walk you to A51.

'''Rita:''' I just remembered that I have something to do in A52… it’s right beside A51.

'''Bianka:''' …Well, in that case, I can’t say no.

'''Rita:''' Alright, let’s go.

'''Rita:''' Speaking of which, you look pretty relaxed. Two years ago, when I took the Valkyrie Admission Test, I was so nervous that I couldn’t speak.

'''Bianka:''' But it’s just a test, right?

'''Rita:''' I guess I was too afraid of letting my family down. They left their own shop in England to accompany me here.

'''Bianka:''' Well… I guess this is a blessing in disguise, huh?

'''Bianka:''' After all, I’ve been alone for as long as I can remember.

'''Rita:''' …Sorry. I didn’t realise.

'''Bianka:''' It’s alright.

'''Bianka:''' I can take care of myself in this world. Why should I envy others?

'''Bianka:''' Besides…

'''Bianka:''' Ah. A51? It’s right here!

'''Rita:''' Yeah, it’s not far.

'''Rita:''' Well, good luck on your test, future Valkyrie.

'''Bianka:''' Uh… I don’t know about all that, but thank you! I really enjoyed talking with you. Bye!

'''Durandal:''' (This is… how I met her.)

'''Durandal:''' (Although we didn’t know each other at the time… This strange destiny connected us through that mission in the Sea of Quanta.)

'''Durandal:''' (After that, we became S-rank Valkyries together and formed the Immortal Blades…)

'''Durandal:''' (In retrospect, we have come so far.)

'''???:''' Then she became good friends with you, right?

'''Durandal:''' Yes, that was the beginning of my Valkyrie career. Although it was a bit messy at first, in hindsight, it’s worth remembering.

'''Durandal:''' …Wait. Why did your voice change?

'''“HOLA”:''' That’s because we’re not “him”, silly.

'''“HOMU”:''' Unlike us, he is a ghostly image left by someone’s consciousness…

'''“HOMEI”:''' In his captivity, he always missed his family… and we are the result of this feeling.

'''“HOLA”:''' He’s so worn out. He doesn’t even know that he doesn’t exist in space the same way you do.

'''“HOMEI”:''' But he sent us here unconsciously. Maybe he hopes that we could take his place and accompany you on this journey.

'''Durandal:''' So… to put it simply, you and he all came from someone’s memory?

'''“HOMEI”:''' Yes. This place is the gap where Imaginary Space becomes entangled, and the shadow left by his countless challenges and failures.

'''“HOLA”:''' Of course, because of your appearance, it is influenced by you as well. For example, that nursing home.

'''Durandal:''' You mean… there’s a connection between us already?

'''“HOMU”:''' Correct. The illusion you just left was originally his remaining memory, the restoration of his home.

'''“HOLA”:''' Due to your intrusion, it was modified by your consciousness to become a nursing home.

'''Durandal:''' (Imaginary Space… the creation of consciousness… will change with memory…?)

'''Durandal:''' Are you saying that the place I’m in now is actually someone’s Stigmata Space?

'''“HOLA”:''' Yes and no. It likely belongs to a cursed family, the imprint of that bloodline at its origin.

'''“HOMEI”:''' We are also mere ghostly images, so what we know is not comprehensive.

'''“HOLA”:''' So we suggest you keep looking for those lost memory fragments. The more you find, the more we can remember.

'''“HOMEI”:''' Your search for memory may have just begun, but we will try to help you return to your own world according to his wish.

'''Durandal:''' …Thank you. I hope he can be free in the end.

'''Durandal:''' Just…

In the girl’s heart, she had always felt sympathy for those unknown heroes with unfortunate fates.

In fact, the reason why she became a Valkyrie was to fulfill the mission that Ragna failed to complete.

At the age of 12, she once opened her heart to Rita under the dreamy, starry sky of that bubble universe…

'''Bianka:''' Well… it’s like some obsessive-compulsive disorder.

'''Bianka:''' If I fail to do the best I can, I’ll be unhappy…

'''Bianka:''' …Ah, I hate explaining this.

'''Bianka:''' I know that my personality is more or less problematic, and I can imagine that I will probably become a boring person because of this in 5 or 10 years…

'''Bianka:''' …But it’s the only way I know how to make myself stronger.

'''Bianka:''' I need to get stronger, and stronger, and even stronger still.

'''Bianka:''' Most of my relatives, teachers, and fellow Valkyries… are gone already.

'''Bianka:''' Their lives came to an abrupt end. Like a piece of paper, they were shredded by some superior evil will.

'''Bianka:''' I hate that. So, whatever they failed to do, I want to try my hardest to make it happen.

In her life so far, the girl had been fulfilling this requirement for herself in her own way.

She knew her weaknesses: short-tempered, reckless, simple-minded, and forgetful…

So she constantly honed herself to become calmer, more practical, more rational, until others began to see her as aloof…

…Still, from time to time, she felt that she was still far from being “the strongest Valkyrie”.

'''Durandal:''' …No. It’s pointless to dream of saving someone else without an achievable plan.

'''Durandal:''' Let’s spring into action. We should hurry up and continue to look in the direction that the Genius pointed to for a breakthrough.

'''“HOLA”:''' …

The fiery-red doll fell silent, as though it saw through what she had experienced. The pink doll on the side saw this and rushed in to save the situation.

'''“HOMEI”:''' You’re right, but the space here is huge. If you fail to touch the memory fragments in time, your own spirit is at risk of getting lost.

'''“HOMU”:''' Please be careful!

'''“HOLA”:''' …

'''“HOLA”:''' They’re right. Don’t get lost.

'''Durandal:''' This memory… seems unreadable.

'''Durandal:''' Well, at least the fog nearby has mostly cleared up.

The school bell that would be in use tomorrow rang in the night.

'''???:''' Well… the bell works fine.

'''???:''' Tomorrow is enrollment day… We only have 10 students, but starting from scratch is never easy.

'''???:''' Cecilia…

'''???:''' St. Freya… will be a new start.

The owner of the memory examined a photo in her hand.

'''???:''' Alas, it’s been almost 10 years.

'''???:''' And in the end, I failed to take care of Kiana…

'''???:''' Now, Siegfried is in exile and can’t be reached… Kiana is seriously injured and has been staying in a fully-enclosed medical tank for over a year.

'''???:''' Grandpa didn’t allow me to visit her… even once.

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' Cecilia, we used to imagine things together, but it seems that only this school became a reality.

'''???:''' Hopefully that when Kiana recovers… she can be a student here too.

'''???:''' Before that… I must work together with the teachers and students here and try to be a competent Principal.

…

'''Durandal:''' (It’s Theresa’s memory this time…)

'''“HOMEI”:''' Theresa… has been working hard in her own way.

'''Durandal:''' Huh?

'''Durandal:''' …You can remember her, right?

'''“HOMU”:''' To be precise, when you touched the memory, your understanding of her was passed to us automatically.

'''“HOLA”:''' As I said, we are freer beings compared to you. We can even learn things that you don’t know through the memories you touch.

'''Durandal:''' So… do you know the source of this space and how it works?

'''“HOLA”:''' No. I guess that requires more intense memory stimulation.

'''“HOLA”:''' For example… the last moments of someone important?

'''“HOMU”:''' Hey! To remember more, you don’t have to use sad memories, right?

'''“HOLA”:''' …But the stimulation is necessary.

'''“HOMU”:''' Hmph, nonsense! I want to see something nice and happy! Nice and happy!

'''“HOLA”:''' …Well, is this what they call “only Alice can defeat Dame de Cœur”?

'''“HOMU”:''' Hey! Are you humiliating me with words I don’t understand?

'''“HOLA”:''' Huh? That’s a compliment. Don’t tell me you’ve never read that fairy tale?!

The two child-like dolls got into an argument. Somehow, it might make someone think that they were good friends.

'''Durandal:''' …Pff.

'''“HOMEI”:''' Haha, kids.

'''Durandal:''' Well… A few years ago, I was like the red one. I was always arguing with others.

'''“HOMEI”:''' But now you’re quite capable and mature.

'''“HOMEI”:''' In the past few years, while growing up… you must have experienced a lot, right?

'''“HOMEI”:''' For kids who hold themselves to a high standard and stick to their own values… they will experience drastic personality changes as they grow up.

'''Durandal:''' It’s okay. I just kept moving forward and before I knew it, I’ve become what I am now. They call it the price of growth, right?

'''“HOMEI”:''' …Maybe. After all, life always makes us pay.

'''“HOMEI”:''' So, are you going to keep going?

'''Durandal:''' Yeah. Let’s call those two squabbling guys over. I’m ready to go.

'''“HOMEI”:''' …

'''“HOMEI”:''' (Mature kids always make you feel sorry for them.)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Slow claps*

'''???:''' You’re back.

'''???:''' That’s good. A meeting like this can help clear up the air between us.

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' Ah, sorry. Did I leave you speechless? My fault.

'''???:''' Well… As a gesture of goodwill, let’s get straight to the point, okay?

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' First, I’m sorry for what happened to Cecilia. But we all know… Schicksal had no choice in that situation.

'''???:''' I’m not here to talk about that today.

'''???:''' I know, I know. Still, I wanted to apologise.

'''???:''' Okay, let’s get to the point now. I have to admit…

'''???:''' …I wanted to kill you.

'''???:''' …!

'''???:''' Oops, you look surprised.

'''???:''' Is that because of my murderous intent… or my frankness?

'''???:''' Anyway, none of that matters. Your daughter, Kiana, will be Schicksal’s most powerful warrior in the future… And I don’t want her to lose her “parents” as a child.

'''???:''' Besides, I noticed that you’ve controlled the power in you pretty well recently. Shall I say that you have amazing willpower…?

'''???:''' Or is that because you live with your daughter now?

'''???:''' …My power is the reason that you wanted to kill me.

'''???:''' Ah… You can say that. After all, I don’t want you to murder your own daughter by accident. You know, that wouldn’t be just a family tragedy…

'''???:''' …But also the loss of Schicksal and all humanity.

The angry man hit the table.

'''???:''' It’s none of your business!

'''???:''' Oops, sorry. I’m just saying. Sorry I didn’t consider your feelings.

'''???:''' You…

'''???:''' Calm down, Siegfried Kaslana, my dear.

'''???:''' Kiana is your daughter and an even greater asset to the Schicksal organisation… We are all in this together.

'''???:''' As long as she grows up healthy, we can cooperate and trust each other… right?

…

'''Durandal:''' (That was the Overseer and… Kiana’s father… Was it sometime after the 2nd Eruption?)

'''“HOMU”:''' Ah! I hate that blond man! How can there be such an arrogant guy like him in the world?

'''“HOLA”:''' Guys like him are perhaps not rare… but I agree with you.

'''“HOMEI”:''' In any case, Overseer Otto… is a very cruel man.

'''Durandal:''' The Overseer… Indeed, he is the one who threw me into Imaginary Space. Now I’m stuck here.

'''Durandal:''' I’m prepared to fight him until he can no longer destroy the world.

'''Durandal:''' But… he doesn’t do insignificant things.

'''Durandal:''' He must have felt compelled to attempt to anger me and others again and again today, even going so far as to do it himself.

'''“HOLA”:''' Hey! You said it yourself, he just hurt you! And you’re defending him?

'''Durandal:''' …I’m only pointing out the obvious.

'''Durandal:''' He brazenly advocates for the world’s annihilation, resorts to violence to avoid being questioned, and refuses to reveal his secrets even while at war with his own Valkyries… There must be another reason.

'''Durandal:''' I am furious and perplexed, but more importantly, I must prevent him from causing irrevocable destruction to the world.

'''Durandal:''' That’s the type of man he is… and he has previously supported me in my training.

'''“HOLA”:''' Hey. But you know in your heart that you’ll always have another conflict with him - there’s no point in caring too much about these minor flavors from the past, right?

'''Durandal:''' …

The pink doll pinched the red doll from the side.

'''“HOMEI”:''' That being said, you should not be too harsh on our visitor. It is normal for humans to experience conflicting emotions in this world.

'''“HOLA”:''' …Hopefully, after seeing more of that person’s memories, she’ll be able to maintain her composure.

'''“HOLA”:''' Let’s get going. I can hardly wait…

'''Durandal:''' Let’s get going. Whatever memories await us, we’ll have to confront them all at some point.

Bali’s lovely beaches are being caressed by gentle waves.

As the sun sets, tired guests exchange questions in many languages, such as “where to eat for supper”.

'''???:''' What a long, exhausting day…

'''???:''' So much harder than combat training… I’m utterly exhausted…

'''???:''' My excellent photographer, you’ve done a terrific job.

'''???:''' No way… I’m doing my part to help my darling wife. There was no effort required.

'''???:''' Yeah, you were obviously just whining about your stamina being entirely depleted.

'''???:''' Uh… so you heard that.

'''???:''' How about… how about I take pictures of you tomorrow?

'''???:''' …Oh? I’m not particularly photogenic.

'''???:''' Gee, this gentleman seems to be completely unaware of his own charm.

'''???:''' You think I have bad taste in men?

'''???:''' Well…

'''???:''' So, just have some confidence in yourself.

'''???:''' If our child grows up, he will only remember his mother as a beautiful young lady, but not his father as a handsome guy…

'''???:''' That will be a shame!

'''???:''' But, even if you want to photograph me, I didn’t pack anything suitable other than the white suit… for the wedding.

'''???:''' Hmmm… of course I would prepare something like that ahead of time.

'''???:''' Why do you think I ditched you the day before we left to go shopping with Theresa and Shigure Kira?

'''???:''' Come on, I’m seriously considering competing in photography with you.

…

'''Durandal:''' (This is… Cecilia and Siegfried’s honeymoon period, I think.)

'''Durandal:''' (Those prior memories, it appears, all belonged to different people… but now two consecutive memories relating to Siegfried have been discovered.)

'''Durandal:''' (That person also stated that forgetting in such a memory space is akin to loss… but what if the opposite happens…)

'''“HOLA”:''' Alas… Happy memories, no?

'''“HOLA”:''' But your Overseer Otto has ruined everything.

'''Durandal:''' …He’s done wrong to everyone in this family. I’ve always known that.

'''“HOLA”:''' Then you do realise that you’re going to go back and beat him up again no matter what now, don’t you?

'''Durandal:''' Yes, I do.

'''Durandal:''' Only… I’ve also been warned not to think solely in terms of outcomes. That would lead to a loss of perspective on much of life’s significance.

'''“HOLA”:''' Well, that Overseer does not appear to be insignificant to you.

'''“HOLA”:''' Why, really, live such a painful life?

'''Durandal:''' …Presumably, no one wants to live with too many contradictions, right? But the universe itself… is a world full of contradictions.

'''Durandal:''' We sometimes select one side of the contradiction and sometimes the exact opposite. These choices shape our lives while also introducing fresh contradictions.

'''Durandal:''' This unbreakable cycle propels the world onward.

'''“HOLA”:''' Okay, so you’re not just a Valkyrie who can fight, but you can also juggle the words of a philosopher.

'''Durandal:''' These words were indeed delivered by a philosopher, and if you have the chance, you might be able to see her in my memory as well.

'''“HOLA”:''' …

'''“HOLA”:''' I think what you just said is deeply ingrained in your principles as a person and has become entirely internalised as your own.

'''“HOLA”:''' But I’m your age, right? Aren’t you sad that you live in such a different way to a regular teenage girl?

'''Durandal:''' Is it necessary for a teen girl to act like a teen girl?

'''“HOLA”:''' Huh?

'''Durandal:''' I am who I am. I can’t transform myself into someone else.

'''Durandal:''' For me, I knew who I wanted to be from the minute I became a Valkyrie.

'''Durandal:''' We are meant to be the most powerful warriors in the world, and we must be constantly prepared…

'''Durandal:''' The determination to battle, to give everything, to bear the unfulfilled destiny of others on one’s shoulders.

'''Durandal:''' To be able to keep this consciousness and devote myself to it forever… I don’t mind if I don’t resemble a teenage girl.

'''“HOLA”:''' …

'''Durandal:''' …

Durandal realised this was a rare moment of her displaying emotion.

Perhaps it was the red figure on the other side that reminded her of the person she once was, or perhaps, after experiencing a succession of memories, those regrets contributed to her distress.

If scholars have an obsession, they call it devoting oneself to historical study, but warriors, on the other hand, have a similar obsession known as fighting on with the hopes of Eroica.

This is the glory of their endurance, this is the meaning of their existence… this is the mission for which they have sacrificed their youth.

'''Durandal:''' …Sorry. I appear to have gotten a little carried away.

'''“HOLA”:''' …

'''“HOLA”:''' It’s not that I don’t know what you’re talking about. You have your own problems, which you find difficult to share with others.

'''“HOLA”:''' I just… think you should put your sanity aside and vent every now and then.

'''Durandal:''' That would be difficult for Rita, wouldn’t it?

'''“HOLA”:''' Huh? I think your friend would be happy to see that happen too, right?

'''Durandal:''' Haha… maybe.

'''“HOMEI”:''' …Pff.

'''Durandal:''' Okay, now that the time for spilling the beans has passed, let’s get to work.

'''Durandal:''' Isn’t it true that there’s a long way to go?

'''Durandal:''' This… flower exists by itself?

A giant submarine is cruising through the ocean currents, swimming in a network that weaves the bubble universe.

'''Bianka:''' …

'''Shakespeare:''' Yo, are you chillin’ out here?

'''Bianka:''' Hey! Don’t approach people from behind, Captain!

'''Shakespeare:''' You appear a little dreary. Are you starting to feel homesick?

'''Bianka:''' …Not at all.

'''Bianka:''' I’m simply… pondering something about the future.

'''Shakespeare:''' Is this about anything that will happen when you return to your own world?

'''Bianka:''' That sort of thing. Maybe it’s not something a typical 12-year-old would consider… but I can’t turn a blind eye to what’s already in my thoughts.

'''Shakespeare:''' Well, after all, we’ve had a number of difficult-to-describe circumstances over the past two days.

'''Shakespeare:''' But hey, there’s no harm in being a little precocious, is there?

'''Bianka:''' …Then I’ll just ask the question straightforwardly.

'''Bianka:''' In your opinion, Captain… why are humans born into this world?

'''Shakespeare:''' That’s a rather straightforward question. How should I put it… Even if we can fill out a birth certificate by hand, we can’t pick our actual birth date, can we?

'''Shakespeare:''' Or would you want to discuss the question, “why does life have to be meaningful?”

'''Bianka:''' That’s one way to put it. Consider this: everyone is born into this world against their will and, for the most part, dies against their will…

'''Bianka:''' And you stated a while ago that the meaning of oneself, human beings, the world, and the universe cannot be assessed in terms of results.

'''Bianka:''' For ourselves, everything eventually fades into oblivion, and we have no power to protect those we love eternally in a long stream of time.

'''Bianka:''' Perhaps the answer to this question rests in believing… yet I have a hard time believing in some metaphysical abstract idea.

'''Shakespeare:''' What can I say, you’re the sort of person that overthinks everything…

'''Shakespeare:''' You should be aware that you already believe in ideals such as truth, goodness, and beauty more than most ordinary people, at least in terms of what counts.

'''Shakespeare:''' I believe the actual problem for you, perhaps, is that truth, goodness, and beauty are a collection of concepts that are simple but ill-defined.

'''Shakespeare:''' Of course, truth, goodness, and beauty can be summarised as the greatest common divisor for society; but for individuals, it is ultimately not anchored in reality.

'''Shakespeare:''' Everyone, after all, has their own quirks and flaws, and like the Greek gods, are flawed beings.

'''Shakespeare:''' …However, only in this way will human “possibilities” increase and human “civilisation” remain relevant.

'''Shakespeare:''' We can only protect something for so long… but that is not the end of meaning, but rather the beginning of where it should be.

'''Bianka:''' Not the end… but the beginning?

'''Shakespeare:''' Yeah. Meaning as a whole of mankind and meaning as an individual are essentially two opposite things.

'''Shakespeare:''' …You can think of it as a mosaic collage in relation to the single mosaic piece itself.

'''Shakespeare:''' Every life that believes it is beautiful is a type of footnote in the history of civilisation; behind every self-fulfillment is someone who casts a shadow in history.

'''Bianka:''' …But that just defines what civilisation is, not what it is to be living.

'''Shakespeare:''' That’s true. No matter what, this so-called “life” will never have any inherent meaning.

'''Bianka:''' …You didn’t simply state, life has no meaning.

'''Shakespeare:''' Well… That’s because finding meaning itself is a meaning that we can give to life.

'''Shakespeare:''' Understand? We do not live as a certain type of person… rather, we live to become that type of person.

'''Shakespeare:''' The ability to create meaning to the meaningless is what distinguishes humans.

'''Bianka:''' So you’re saying that… our lives are a never-ending quest for a better version of ourselves.

'''Shakespeare:''' Yes, exactly. Some liken it to Sisyphus pushing a boulder because it never stops.

'''Shakespeare:''' In their myth, Sisyphus labored to push the boulder up the mountain, then watched helplessly as it slid back down, so on and so forth.

'''Shakespeare:''' But even they would confess… that while Sisyphus was trapped in a never-ending circle of misery, his existence seemed meaningless…

'''Shakespeare:''' But that didn’t stop Sisyphus from forging a life purpose that opposes the gods and lauds freedom.

'''Shakespeare:''' When you forsake consequentialism, you see that Sisyphus did live his life to the fullest, achieving the most fundamental sort of human happiness.

'''Bianka:''' …You mean the happiness that comes from recognising that you’re not living for nothing, or at the very least acknowledging you’re struggling with meaninglessness.

'''Shakespeare:''' Without a doubt. It’s the best type of struggle in everyone’s journey through life.

'''Shakespeare:''' We battle the world while reconciling with it, eventually acquiring meaning…

'''Shakespeare:''' …And finally, to be able to walk off the stage with a great smile and no regrets in the face of that eternal nothingness.

…

'''“HOLA”:''' Alright… I have to admit, at first she had me pretty confused, but then cleared things up, to see something entirely new.

'''“HOLA”:''' She does have her own caliber, but it appears to me that it’s just a giant circle and back to square one.

'''Durandal:''' In a sense it does.

'''Durandal:''' However, the same scenario can produce quite a different mood.

'''“HOLA”:''' Hey… No more talk about Sisyphus.

'''“HOLA”:''' And there is, in fact, one individual in the world whose fate is much more tragic than Sisyphus’.

'''“HOLA”:''' You know his name too…

'''“HOMU”:''' Hey, you can’t do that! We shouldn’t tell her things that she doesn’t know about yet!

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' So you do know certain facts that I don’t yet know.

'''“HOMU”:''' Ah… no, how should I put it…

'''“HOMEI”:''' …They are things that, even if you are unaware of them, your body and soul can assist us in knowing.

'''Durandal:''' Do you guys… know about my past?

'''“HOMEI”:''' No, it’s not quite that straightforward. However, spending time with you gradually reminds us of something that you have no way of knowing yourself.

'''“HOMEI”:''' Yes, you have an almost inherent resonance with the “him” that makes us who we are.

'''Durandal:''' I’m sorry… but I have no idea what you’re talking about.

'''“HOLA”:''' That’s okay. Our adventure on this level appears to be coming to a conclusion now that your own flowers have appeared.

'''“HOMU”:''' And, assuming our predictions are true, at the next level…

'''“HOMEI”:''' …You will confront all of his most crucial memories.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''“HOMEI”:''' If you make it all the way to the end… the jAdjudicator should be waiting for you.

'''“HOMU”:''' It wasn’t on purpose, but he did pave the way for you.

'''“HOLA”:''' …Consider it as compensation for unwittingly impeding your return to reality.

'''“HOMEI”:''' These memories and experiences could prove useful while dealing with the Adjudicator.

'''Durandal:''' Which means…

'''Durandal:''' …I’m going to have to confront his life piece by piece before finding my way back to reality at the Adjudicator, right?

'''“HOMEI”:''' Yes, that’s right.

'''“HOLA”:''' We are nothing more than resonance vessels of consciousness that emerge and disappear as you pass by. You don’t have to say goodbye to us…

'''“HOLA”:''' Because we are both him and you.

'''“HOMU”:''' Do your best, the strongest Valkyrie of Schicksal!

'''“HOMEI”:''' I am certain that you will be able to get past his regrets and continue forward.

'''“HOLA”:''' Feel it with your heart… then assume his place and beat up those arrogant bastards in one sweep!

Unlike the earlier huge doll…

The bodies of the small dolls had begun to dissolve by the time the device appeared.

Durandal felt everything in silence. She might have received a premonition…

…How will she witness what “Sisyphus” bears on his back in the events that follow?

'''???:''' …Found you!

'''Huge Doll:''' Wh-Who is it? Come out now!

'''???:''' You will vanish if I take on a form.

'''Huge Doll:''' …?

'''???:''' You’ve accumulated quite a few memories of yourself here after being separated from that person, haven’t you?

'''???:''' Unfortunately, that won’t make you “him” again.

'''Huge Doll:''' …

'''???:''' You’ve finally remembered who you are.

'''???:''' You’re well aware that you’re incapable of doing anything worthwhile right now.

'''???:''' That is, you already realise that you are nothing more than a destabilising element that will get in her way.

'''Huge Doll:''' If you are who I assume you are… you will wreak havoc on her life more than I would.

'''???:''' Perhaps. But that was also her fate… just as it was yours at first.

'''Huge Doll:''' Whoever inherits the Kaslana name must defeat the Honkai at whatever cost… right?

'''???:''' As I said, it is fate. If you want to complain… just accept that the former you was too weak.

'''???:''' …Though even more so now.

'''Huge Doll:''' …!

The strange consciousness that had earlier permeated the space was now swiftly congregating on its intended victim.

It erased the victim’s inherent individual persona in an instant, leaving just pathetic and warped flesh.

'''???:''' Poor Siegfried. This persona fragment you left behind… is now on loan to me.

'''???:''' Those more accurately-located memories will disclose to me what it is that makes her such a peculiar individual now.

Meanwhile, the young girl was still immersed in memories influenced by the device.

…This was the day she had just acquired the Abyss Flower.

'''Otto:''' Time goes by so quickly.

'''Otto:''' You’ve become an S-rank Valkyrie in the blink of an eye.

'''Bianka:''' Putting up the effort always pays off. It’s a foregone conclusion, Overseer.

'''Otto:''' Haha, for you… it is, isn’t it?

'''Otto:''' But guess what? It took almost a year for me to bring you back to consciousness when I initially started treating you.

'''Bianka:''' …You mentioned that I was badly injured in an accident as a child.

'''Bianka:''' And the reason that you were the primary doctor who treated me was also due to the fact that everyone else was at their wit’s end at the time.

'''Otto:''' Haha. It just so happened that I was experimenting with a new technique, a one-of-a-kind treatment that I developed while upgrading my prosthetics…

'''Otto:''' Using Soulium as a medium for manipulating Stigmata, artificially promoting stem cell re-division so that the metrics of the new living tissues can finally be equivalent to Soulium.

'''Otto:''' You’re lucky… of all the subjects who had this therapy, you’re the only one that lived successfully… and healed almost entirely and well above expectations.

'''Otto:''' Even the only blemish that treatment left you with was this lovely, unique curled hair, like a winter billow.

'''Bianka:''' …I’ll ignore the jokes for now.

'''Bianka:''' After all, without such an experience, I’m sure I wouldn’t have been able to transform my body into a sword and reverse the bubble universe into myself during that operation in the Sea of Quanta.

'''Otto:''' Heh, that’s what they call a karmic coincidence.

'''Otto:''' Life is full of surprises hidden for us in unexpected places, and the ability to locate them in time may be the difference between comedy and tragedy.

'''Bianka:''' That is why those who are fortunate in life should strive to live up to their destinies.

'''Otto:''' Hmm. That is true… It’s just that we don’t always recognise what we should be striving for.

'''Otto:''' Oh, by the way. Have you ever heard of the name “Kiana Kaslana”?

'''Bianka:''' No. Is it someone from the Kaslana family?

'''Otto:''' Well, sort of. There isn’t much to say about her… except that her clone holds the Core of the Herrscher of the Void.

'''Bianka:''' Sounds very dangerous.

'''Otto:''' Not necessarily. She has a good father, one who treats her as if she were his own daughter. That will ultimately offer her a taste of human affection.

'''Otto:''' Don’t you think that’s fantastic, Durandal? If only we could make the Herrscher Core function as calmly as the bubble universe within you…

'''Otto:''' Wouldn’t the solution to the Honkai be just around the corner?

'''Otto:''' Had the Sovereign of Anti-Entropy, the Herrscher of Reason who fought for humanity, not been so petty, we wouldn’t have had to go through all the trouble of try to experiment on a clone of the Herrscher of the Void.

Oto: Of course, this is not to suggest that the power of the Herrscher of the Void is insignificant. She may be able to preserve that bubble universe of yours, but the Herrscher of Reason will never be able to.

'''Otto:''' If the 1st Herrscher had chosen to fight for mankind… I believe Schicksal would have long ago developed a proven strategy of uniting the Herrschers.

'''Otto:''' It’s a shame that… that man, despite having a human heart by change, made him and his successors willful and irresponsible when it came to important issues.

'''Bianka:''' You’re referring to the situation in which Anti-Entropy has been acting against Schicksal?

'''Otto:''' That’s right. Let’s talk about this second Herrscher of Reason.

Otto” I killed his father for some pressing reason… and he still carries a grudge against me, persisting on battling me for decades.

'''Otto:''' How should I put it? He’s lost his father, but he still has me, right? I mean, I can absolutely be his guider, can’t I? In the same way that I have fostered you.

'''Bianka:''' …

'''Otto:''' Oh, why am I getting carried away talking about it? This isn’t good, this isn’t good.

'''Otto:''' Anyway, I’m a bad example when it comes to the 1st Herrscher… You might as well take a cue from me, Durandal.

'''Otto:''' True saviors must be able to cut off all of their emotions when necessary…

'''Otto:''' And Otto Apocalypse was incapable of doing so from the start.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' (Overseer… Are you not used to keeping your mouth shut, or do you keep your true self hidden from the rest of the world?)

'''Durandal:''' (Did you use deception to exile me to Imaginary Space just because you thought I was interfering with your goals, or did you do it on purpose and with ulterior motives?)

'''Durandal:''' (If the latter is the case… your weird behavior today makes sense, but your true plan becomes even more perplexing.)

'''Durandal:''' (Imaginary Space… the Honkai’s origin… what are you really expecting?)

Bianka “Durandal” Ataegina was in an unknown realm of consciousness, getting closer to the exit suggested by the Genius.

The Adjudicator was still nowhere to be found, and she was no longer accompanied by her doll companions who she unexpectedly encountered.

…The key is about to appear now.

…

'''???:''' (I can’t feel anything…)

'''???:''' (Am I dead?)

'''???:''' (…!)

'''???:''' (Cecilia… is that you?)

'''???:''' (Are you… crying?)

'''???:''' Sorry… Siegfried…

'''???:''' I lied to you.

'''???:''' …This time, I won’t be able to go back with you.

'''???:''' Take care of Kiana and make sure she’ll grow up healthy…

''[CG plays wherein a film reel flashes past, showing every past memory of Siegfried shown to Durandal and then some, focusing in on Siegfried sneaking out of the Kaslana estate.'']

You used to run against the wind. The air of freedom nourishes your lungs and purifies your soul.

You left the family mission behind. At this moment, you just want to know the world in your own way.

Back then, you thought you could do anything.

'''???:''' Hahaha! Scream with me, Arahato!

''[CG plays wherein it’s practically a repeat of the last, memories of Siegfried all lined up in a film reel, settling on Siegfried caring for Cecilia the night after they met.'']

Later, you and her met unexpectedly.

At that time, you probably didn’t expect that this innocent girl who made you worry about her would become a great mother in the future.

'''???:''' Haha, you don’t have to tell me what happened last night. I hate being involved in troubles anyway.

'''???:''' It’s very safe here. You can stay here for a few days and recover.

'''???:''' No… I can’t. I still have missions to complete. I have to go… go back to headquarters.

'''???:''' Wait… in your opinion, your mission is more important than your own health?

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' Hey, I’ve changed my mind. Since you have to leave now, let me see you off.

''[CG plays wherein once more, moving through the memories and landing on Siegfried’s time out in the town with Cecilia.'']

During the fateful encounter that day, you made her experience the taste of “freedom”…

'''???:''' Wow! The picture on the screen is moving! So that’s how it works!

'''???:''' What do you think? Games are fun, right? It’s a pity that I was careless today and didn’t get first place.

'''???:''' …Can I try?

'''???:''' Of course! But don’t be too upset if you lose. This is the latest game console, and also the most difficult one.

'''???:''' Even if you’ve received a lot of training before, real fighting and playing games are not the same…

'''???:''' Awesome, I win!

''[CG plays wherein the memories flash by again, this time stopping at Siegfried’s proposal to Cecilia.'']

You fell in love with her and vowed to give her happiness and freedom in your own way.

Of course, you didn’t know at this time that one day she would sacrifice her own life for you.

'''???:''' Anyway, I have to say thank you this time, Grandpa.

'''???:''' I haven’t seen Cecilia’s heartfelt smile in a long, long time.

'''???:''' …Thank me?. Haha, my cute Theresa. You wouldn’t think I did this out of good intentions, would you?

'''???:''' I just want to know if a more powerful “Herrscher Killer” would be born once the purified Schariac bloodline and the Kaslana bloodline are combined.

''[CG plays wherein once again the memories flash, leaving us with nothing but darkness.'']

In the year 2000, you lost her.

And seven years later… you lost the most precious treasure she gave you…

The only spiritual sustenance you have left is something that is essentially contrary to your “family mission”…

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' Siegfried, how much longer are you gonna ignore me for?

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' Hey! Stop there!

'''???:''' Tsk.

'''???:''' I also would like to know, Miss Tesla. How long are you gonna keep following me for?

'''???:''' …You’re finally talking to me.

'''???:''' It’s been a long time, Mr. Siegfried.

'''???:''' What have you got to say, Dr. Tesla? I have a family I need to support.

'''???:''' Two years ago, our Anti-Entropy troops…

'''???:''' If that’s what you wanna talk about, I don’t want to hear your explanation.

'''???:''' It was because you didn’t respond in time, so Kiana…

'''???:''' …Sorry, we’re really sorry. About K423…

'''???:''' Anti-Entropy guaranteed my safety and Kiana’s, which was the condition for me to give her to you.

'''???:''' My deal with you has long since ended. Goodbye.

'''???:''' Wait!

'''???:''' I’m not asking you to hand over K423 to us.

'''???:''' If… if you really want to see her as your daughter.

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' I don’t know what you’re talking about, Dr. Tesla.

'''???:''' If there is nothing else, I really have to go.

'''???:''' …Siegfried!

'''???:''' K423, although she’s your daughter’s clone…

'''???:''' She still has the 2nd Herrscher’s genes, Core and consciousness in her body. You should be aware of that.

'''???:''' But on the other hand… if there is someone around her who can make her realise what love is, then the 2nd Herrscher part of her may be suppressed…

'''???:''' As long as you play the role of father well, you can continue to keep her by your side, and the whole world might gain some respite.

The memory’s owner slaps the table angrily.

'''???:''' “Play”? What do you mean, “play”? Unbelievable!

'''???:''' Do you still remember that your name is “Anti-Entropy”, not “Schicksal”?!

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' Whether you see her as your own daughter, or it’s all out of pity, that’s your choice.

'''???:''' But…

'''???:''' What should I call her? Does she have a name? Should I just call her “Siegfried’s daughter”?

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' Mr. Siegfried, living in this world, in addition to being the children of their parents, they are more themselves.

'''???:''' That’s what a name does, it helps us know ourselves and hints at the path we’ll take in the future.

'''???:''' So I’m curious, what exactly are you going to call your daughter?

'''???:''' Does she only deserve to be called “K423” and not have her own name?

'''???:''' …

'''???:''' Think about it, Mr. Siegfried.

'''???:''' It’s not just about you or your family.

'''???:''' The whole world… may be waiting for your answer.

…

'''Durandal:''' (This series of memories, are they…)

'''???:''' This is the memory of a person who failed to become a “hero”.

'''Durandal:''' …Who?

'''???:''' I’m this space itself. I’m also the will that secretly guides you to discover your own destiny along the way.

'''Durandal:''' But… you’re not one of those puppets.

'''???:''' Of course I’m not. If you have to find a way to describe me…

'''???:''' I should be the monument to destiny that provides you with the way forward.

'''Durandal:''' You want me to know that person’s memory. Why?

'''???:''' I remember you said…

'''???:''' That your outlook on life is to take on the unfinished business of those who can no longer carry their own destiny.

'''Durandal:''' …I must tell you that I don’t like being summed up so rashly.

'''Durandal:''' If you really have something you want to tell me, how about you show me directly?

'''???:''' That would be a little difficult.

'''???:''' After all, there are things in you that even I think are very rare… they are resisting my power and providing you with guidance similar to my own.

'''???:''' …Why don’t you see what they are trying to tell you first?

The consciousness that had pervaded the entire space suddenly disappeared just now.

This made the girl realise one thing.

If she wants to question this suspicious existence, if she wants to leave this weird space, if she wants to return to the frontlines of Klostern in time…

She needs to at least find a chance to talk to this mysterious being “face-to-face”.

'''Durandal:''' Of course. Like the stele to dark fate, it isn’t just one type of existence.

…

The car’s horn broke the silence of the twilight and brought a slightly comforting breath of life.

'''Father:''' Passed, Kiana.

'''Daughter:''' Ah… that scared me.

'''Daughter:''' Dad, I didn’t reveal anything, did I?

'''Father:''' No, you did a great job. No one would suspect a thing.

'''Daughter:''' That’s good!

'''Daughter:''' …But this cube is too hard. I almost forgot what we were here for.

'''Father:''' Haha, it looks more natural this way and we won’t be found out by others.

'''Daughter:''' Hmmm… but the “2007 Latest Anti-Entropy Invasion Manual” says that when you are disguised, you’re best disguised as your usual self…

'''Father:''' Yes, and the usual Kiana can’t solve the cube either.

'''Daughter:''' Wow, you’re so smart, Dad!

'''Daughter:''' Huh? Wait, is that what the manual meant…?

'''Daughter:''' Hmm… “The more details you have, the less likely your disguise is to be uncovered”. That seems to be the case.

'''Father:''' Alright, hurry up and hide that booklet. Also, don’t talk about Anti-Entropy at all the whole time.

'''Daughter:''' Humph, you don’t have to worry about that. Of course I know that we’re working for Schicksal now.

'''Daughter:''' Yes, Anti-Entropy is really, really bad!

'''Daughter:''' Darn it. I don’t know how the Anti-Entropy agents managed to get in. They’re here to steal Schicksal’s secret experimental results!

'''Father:''' Hush…

'''Father:''' Now is not the time for jokes. I know we’ve carefully checked this car with professional instruments, but we still need to be careful. Someone may hear us.

'''Daughter:''' Hmm… then let’s keep a serious attitude, keep it serious.

…

'''Durandal:''' He and the young Kiana Kaslana? Where are they trying to invade?

'''Durandal:''' Wait… When is this?

'''Father:''' Alright, Kiana. Go over the plan again.

'''Daughter:''' First, we set off from the family villa where we’ve lived for several days, and take the car to the research center on the outskirts of Klostern.

'''Daughter:''' After arriving at the research center, we’ll go to your exclusive training room. There, if anyone talks to us…

'''Daughter:''' I’ll just ask you to teach me the Kaslana Gun Kata since you’re finally home.

'''Daughter:''' And then, when we enter the training room, we climb through the window to the idle locker room in the next building…

'''Daughter:''' You’re going to put on a chemical protective suit to pretend to be a worker who maintains the equipment. Meanwhile, I’ll hide in the waste bin that you’re gonna deliver.

'''Daughter:''' When everything is ready, we go to the testing area’s scrap yard. I can climb back into the core area of the test floor from the scrap hole there.

'''Daughter:''' During this time, you’ll get a stealth combat mech, and I’ll cut open a window from the inside of the test floor to get you in.

'''Daughter:''' Finally, we’ll need to find the laboratory where the clone is and get her out of the hands of those bad guys! If we encounter interception, we’ll have to fight our way out!

'''Father:''' …Great, there shouldn’t be any issues.

'''Father:''' But you must remember that the more people talk to us, the more we have to keep calm…

'''Daughter:''' I know! Look, it’s been written in this Anti-Entropy “Agent’s Handbook”: The most important thing for performing stealth missions is to put on a poker face!

'''Daughter:''' …”Now, guess what cards I have in my hand?”

'''Father:''' Hahaha… Sometimes, you’re just like your Mum…

'''Father:''' Alright, we don’t have much time. Let’s go.

'''Father:''' I don’t think we’ll come back to this house again.

…

'''Durandal:''' (This memory just now… seems to have happened before them driving somewhere?)

'''Durandal:''' (The Anti-Entropy agent’s manual has been mentioned several times in this memory, and the more critical thing is…)

'''Durandal:''' (That girl mentioned a clone, and said that she wanted to save her from the bad guys.)

'''Durandal:''' (In other words, these two memories are…)

'''???:''' Very good, you realised this with the help of that other power.

'''Durandal:''' I must say, I don’t like to talk to someone who hides themselves.

'''Durandal:''' Just be straightforward, what do you want to see or get from me?

'''???:''' We’ll meet soon.

'''???:''' I’ve said it before. I’m the consciousness of this space…

'''???:''' Furthermore, I’m also the judge who provides you with trials.

'''???:''' My current personality comes from a personality fragment you just saw and left here…

'''???:''' Siegfried Kaslana.

'''Durandal:''' …You’re not like him at all.

'''???:''' Maybe. After all, I don’t have complete feelings as you humans do.

'''???:''' However, since the conditions are pretty much all ready…

'''???:''' It’s time for you to see me face-to-face.

'''???:''' Raise from your memories, Valkyrie.

'''???:''' Both of your strengths lie in anticipation.

'''Durandal:''' …Do I want to go to the end?

The train galloped all the way in the moonlight in the middle of the night, and the iron wheels made a lazy beat on the lonely steel rail.

'''Shigure Kira:''' Bianka, why are you still up?

'''Bianka:''' …Aren’t you the same, Kira? It’s hard to fall asleep on the train bed.

'''Bianka:''' …Although, Rita’s sleeping like a baby.

'''Shigure Kira:''' Haha. If that’s the case, do you want me to tell you a story before going to bed?

'''Shigure Kira:''' Not the ordinary ones… but a story about one specific family.

'''Bianka:''' One specific family?

'''Shigure Kira:''' You may also know that Lady Cecilia has a child. If you add up the years… she should be about the same age as you, around thirteen.

'''Bianka:''' Hmm… but I’ve never seen such a person at Schicksal HQ. What happened to her?

'''Shigure Kira:''' She was born with high hopes. Even Overseer Otto said that when she grew up, she might become the strongest Valkyrie in Schicksal’s history.

'''Shigure Kira:''' It isn’t all that surprising. After all, her father was from the Kaslana family, and her mother had the purest holy blood in the Schariac family.

'''Shigure Kira:''' People all expected that such a child would become another Herrscher Killer and another key to ending the Honkai.

'''Bianka:''' But judging from the current situation… it doesn’t seem to be the case. At least I haven’t heard of her.

'''Shigure Kira:''' Haha, indeed. Having said that, it’s probably because the two bloodlines have an inhibitory effect on each other…

'''Shigure Kira:''' After the child was born, no one could see anything special about her. This made the Overseer somewhat frustrated, but it made Lady Cecilia very happy.

'''Bianka:''' Huh? Why?

'''Shigure Kira:''' Because in this way, her child would be able to have a childhood like a normal kid.

'''Shigure Kira:''' Lady Cecilia, as the “result” of the Schariac bloodline… she didn’t want her own child to suffer the same fate as she had.

'''Shigure Kira:''' It’s just that if the child wants to become a warrior like her parents out of her own will when she grows up…

'''Shigure Kira:''' I think, neither Lady Cecilia or Siegfried would stop her, wouldn’t they?

'''Bianka:''' Because that is the result of free will, right?

'''Shigure Kira:''' Yeah. As long as it’s someone’s deliberate decision, even if they deliberately cater to their so-called destiny, it’s by no means a life controlled by external forces.

'''Shigure Kira:''' For example, in my hometown there is a saying that everyone has a certain destiny predetermined by God at the very beginning of their birth.

'''Shigure Kira:''' The meaning of each person’s life is to search for a potential destiny with their own will, and to sublimate their personality in the process.

'''Shigure Kira:''' If generations of people choose the same path by their own will, that path will be thought of as having some kind of divinity.

'''Bianka:''' Just like the three major families of Schicksal.

'''Shigure Kira:''' Haha, that’s true, from a more positive point of view.

'''Shigure Kira:''' Lady Cecilia is not afraid of such a fate. For her, the more important thing is… that this is something everyone must decide for themselves.

'''Shigure Kira:''' Whether they be parents, elders, bosses, or anyone else, they have no right and cannot help another person designate the meaning of their life.

'''Shigure Kira:''' If someone has to intervene in someone else’s life… then they can only make everyone unhappy.

'''Bianka:''' She hopes that her child will have enough time to slowly find out the path she wants to take as she grows up.

'''Shigure Kira:''' Yes. Even if a person insists on the same dream from childhood to adulthood, the whole journey is a necessary part.

'''Bianka:''' …To make a person fully feel your determination. I understand that.

'''Shigure Kira:''' Haha, You’re so mature for a child, Bianka.

'''Bianka:''' Isn’t that fitting for the “youngest A-rank Valkyrie in history?”

'''Bianka:''' Also, as you said during the day, every industry has people who have their own persistence and excellence.

'''Bianka:''' Without a serious attitude as the foundation, without firm determination, no one can achieve real success, right?

'''Shigure Kira:''' It seems you’ve said all that needed to be said. But as we were talking about…

'''Shigure Kira:''' The name “Kiana Kaslana”… have you really never heard of it?

'''Bianka:''' …No.

'''Bianka:''' If you care about it so much… Maybe you should ask Rita another day. After all, her work gives her access to more rumors and gossip.

'''Shigure Kira:''' …

'''Shigure Kira:''' I see. It’s okay, I’m just a little worried is all.

'''Shigure Kira:''' After all, Lady Cecilia didn’t survive the 2nd Eruption. As for Siegfried… according to what you said, he’s currently missing.

'''Bianka:''' Yeah. If you think in this way, the child is actually a bit pitiful.

'''Bianka:''' However, there’s always a way. Having lived in an orphanage, I understand that the pain of losing a loved one doesn’t bring down kids like us.

'''Bianka:''' This will only make us more able to endure hardship, more persevering, and harder working than others. We’ll live for ourselves and also for our families.

'''Bianka:''' This is both our persistence and our pride. We believe from the bottom of our hearts that if fate closes a door for you, it will also open another.

'''Bianka:''' Although I don’t know what kind of dream this Kiana person has…

'''Bianka:''' I believe that it must be like me wanting to be “the strongest Valkyrie in history”. No matter how ridiculous people think it is, we’re still gonna make it come true!

'''Shigure Kira:''' …

'''Bianka:''' Even if you fail… according to the Captain, the hard work you put in the process of trying to prove yourself will eventually turn into the most precious wealth in your life.

'''Shigure Kira:''' …You’re not alluding to my idol career, are you?

'''Bianka:''' Huh? No, no, I wasn’t thinking about that at all!

'''Shigure Kira:''' Relax, I’m only joking. Don’t take it seriously.

'''Bianka:''' …Hmm. Alright, I’m always too serious when I chat with others.

'''Bianka:''' To be honest, I sometimes envy the way you and Rita handle things. But when I give it a second thought, I also think…

'''Bianka:''' “If I’m like them, how much time do I have to waste on things that I think are meaningless!”

'''Shigure Kira:''' Pfft! What a random thought, Bianka.

'''Bianka:''' Hmm… I feel like I’m being mocked. Is it just in my head?

'''Shigure Kira:''' Not really. You’re great in every way. Most people probably haven’t even received Valkyrie training when they’re your age.

'''Shigure Kira:''' You’ve entered the adult world directly at your current age… in this case, it’s very important to have a clear sense of purpose.

'''Shigure Kira:''' I think it’s that, and an unyielding character, that will allow you to fully realise your potential in the future.

'''Shigure Kira:''' The strongest one in history… this is something you can achieve, just like Lady Cecilia did in the past.

…

'''???:''' That idol, she likes to compare you to someone named Cecilia. It’s a pity that she’s not a true benchmark of the “strongest”.

'''Durandal:''' …You’re finally starting to invade my memory directly. Do you enjoy the feeling of interfering with others?

'''???:''' Enjoy? I don’t feel that. Maybe your Overseer can explain to me whether he enjoys it in a similar way.

'''Durandal:''' …How much do you know about Otto?

'''???:''' It was your memory that told me.

'''???:''' Apart from that… I can tell you that you were deliberately sent here by his power.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' But you don’t seem to be working with him.

'''???:''' Of course. He just wants his plan to go smoothly, and to exclude variables like me…

'''???:''' The moment he put you here, he had mostly achieved this purpose.

'''???:''' I’m just a spectator outside the world… but he’s a clown able to mess up the world’s blueprint.

'''Durandal:''' …You think there is a blueprint for this world?

'''???:''' Oh? You seem to be pretty good at catching the truth through words.

'''???:''' Fine, this isn’t a secret that I can keep from you.

'''???:''' However, on this topic, we don’t have to stay in the cracks of the previous memory to discuss.

'''Durandal:''' This is… the earliest place…

'''“Huge Doll”:''' Okay, let’s discuss the remaining problems face-to-face.

'''Durandal:''' …You look quite surprising.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' This tiny detail is not something you should care about. After all, I’m just a shadow that must cling to others to communicate with you.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' I am the will of this space, an extension of the Stigmata. I know this explanation just sounds like a complex stack of terminology to you.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' As it is for you, Stigmata itself is just a destiny from 50,000 years ago, engraved in the DNA.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' You think you have free will, but your freedom is often just an illusion, an inevitable result of a predestined impulse for you.

'''Durandal:''' Now that you’ve shown up here, I will defeat you. Don’t you claim to be a trialist?

'''“Huge Doll”:''' Hahahaha. You’re so direct.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' But you are right. Defeat me and you will have true freedom and gain enough power to defeat Otto. However…

'''“Huge Doll”:''' I’m afraid common attacks won’t be effective against me.

'''Durandal:''' I need to defeat you under the rules you set.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' You could say that, although I’m neither the founder of this space nor the rules.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' Everything I’m doing is just to guide his descendants, the successors of that particular Stigmata.

'''Durandal:''' The successors of that particular Stigmata… Do you mean someone like Siegfried? Or does that include me as well?

'''“Huge Doll”:''' Siegfried… What a poor man. I can’t help but feel sorry for him.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' He has clearly lost his chance to awaken, yet he still challenges me again and again.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' I’ve warned him that it would only hurt him deeper… that it would peel off more and more pieces of his personality…

'''“Huge Doll”:''' But he is as stubborn as a mule, just like his ancestor.

'''Durandal:''' Who is that?

'''“Huge Doll”:''' Who else could it be? His ancestor, Kevin Kaslana…

'''“Huge Doll”:''' His bloodline has passed on a special Stigmata to this day, giving birth to this space and to me.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' You have fought him. I’m sure you understand what kind of being he is.

'''Durandal:''' You… can see even my memory?

'''“Huge Doll”:''' Of course. Remember the monuments to dark memories you saw along the way?

'''“Huge Doll”:''' They are the past that floats around you as the whole space rises and falls… the waves that I create as I traverse the sea of memories…

'''“Huge Doll”:''' …It means that the more you explore this space, the closer and more bound you will become to me.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' If you’re still wondering about the reason for this, I can show you some memories that you missed before I tell you.

'''Durandal:''' …?

'''“Huge Doll”:''' This may be more or less unfair to you… but since you want to regain your independence from me, it is something you have to deal with.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' …Are you ready?

'''Durandal:''' …!

'''Otto:''' Oh, Ragna. You’re just in time.

'''Ragna:''' Overseer, this is…

'''Otto:''' She is the child you rescued. She is very badly injured, so I have to implement a special course of treatment for her.

'''Ragna:''' …So you think she will survive?

'''Otto:''' She is a tough one, isn’t she? Being hit directly in the head by debris from a craft several thousand meters in the air and falling deep into the snowy mountains…

'''Otto:''' After all that, she still had vital signs when you found her. What an extraordinary tenacity she has.

'''Otto:''' The Soulium wrapped around her is just for stimulating her innate cellular repair… I don’t even need to replace any of her bodily tissue.

'''Ragna:''' So she will totally be herself? Not a strand of hair altered?

'''Otto:''' That’s definitely overstating it a little, but it’s the case for the most part. I don’t need to create a Soulium clone. She’ll be the strongest Valkyrie.

'''Otto:''' It’s a blessing in disguise.

'''Ragna:''' What about Siegfried and Theresa…?

'''Otto:''' I will handle them. No need to worry about my family affairs.

'''Ragna:''' …Yes.

'''Otto:''' I can tell you ahead of that…

'''Otto:''' …I don’t want her to be Kiana Kaslana anymore.

'''Otto:''' She has the right to do away with all of that adult strife and set out on her true path to becoming the strongest warrior Schicksal has ever seen.

'''Ragna:''' …

'''Otto:''' When she wakes up, she will have a brand new name and a fresh start. She will be completely free of the personal vendetta that troubled her so much…

'''Otto:''' …She’ll become a better and more beneficial character for Schicksal, and for the future of humanity.

'''Otto:''' I’m sure you understand, right, Miss Ragna Lodbrok?

'''Ragna:''' If she ever realises that she has been outright deceived… what are you going to do then?

'''Otto:''' That’s none of your concern either, Ragna. But, I don’t want to hide anything from you…

'''Otto:''' So let me put it this way. When the time comes, I will give her a far more important mission than her personal vendetta.

'''Otto:''' Once she accomplishes the mission… she will also achieve her revenge on me.

'''Otto:''' It will be a happy ending for all. Don’t you think it’s a great plan?

…

'''Durandal:''' What you just showed me was… Ragna’s memories?

'''“Kiana”:''' No, not hers.

'''Durandal:''' Kiana? No… is this another form you can take?

'''Otto (?):''' Just for a brief moment.

'''Rita (?):''' Forms taken can last longer if it’s someone you remember knowing.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' If this memory does not belong to Ragna, it must belong to Otto.

'''Rita (?):''' Sadly, it doesn’t. Remember what I said earlier? These memories are proof that you are in bondage to me.

'''Rita (?):''' Put another way, this field I guard can only hold the memories of the same group of people.

'''Rita (?):''' For this group, the original Stigmata is passed down in their bloodline, and as such has left them deeply cursed by history.

'''Rita (?):''' Here, countless generations of memories, conscious or subconscious, willing or unwilling…

'''Rita (?):''' …Will spontaneously come to me and join this Stigmata space named “Kaslana”, because they share this immensely special bloodline.

'''Durandal:''' So you’re saying… the memory I just saw is actually from a third party…?

'''Rita (?):''' That’s right. It belonged to the child in the memory who was wrapped in Otto’s Soulium for treatment.

'''Rita (?):''' Try to recall what you’ve seen here so far…

'''Rita (?):''' Dr. MEI’s child, Kallen and her father, Theresa, Siegfried, and that child… They have the same blood flowing through them, as well as the same Stigmata.

'''Durandal:''' And being in Imaginary Space, I’m entangled with this Stigmata space, with you…

'''Durandal:''' My memories are thus mixed with theirs, causing me to be unable to return to my original world. And all this is part of Otto’s plan.

'''Rita (?):''' It’s a logical deduction.

'''Rita (?):''' Although your memories didn’t belong here before you arrived, it’s no coincidence that you are entangled with this space.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Rita (?):''' As I said earlier, experiencing memories like that one would be somewhat unfair to you…

'''Rita (?):''' Because being part of me, part of the Kaslana’s Stigmata, is the basis for their existence…

'''Rita (?):''' For some reason, they are not settled in my space, but in you.

'''Rita (?):''' For a better understanding, Miss Durandal…

'''Rita (?):''' Not only are you from the pure bloodline of Kaslana… but the memory we just saw was actually recorded from your own senses.

'''Rita (?):''' You… are the third party to that memory.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Rita (?):''' In that memory, Otto Apocalypse called you by the name…

'''Rita (?):''' Kiana Kaslana.

'''Durandal:''' …

…

The girl is experiencing mixed feelings. Yet, not because of the sudden knowledge of her origins nor because the name has any special meaning to her.

“You are who you are, and it has nothing to do with your name.”

“What’s the big deal about family names? It’s not a hand, or a foot, or an arm, or a face… It’s not an actual part of a person.”

“What’s the big deal about names in general? A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet.”

“Even if Romeo weren’t named Romeo, he would be just as gracious and perfect. He does not need any superfluous title.”

The girl was having mixed feelings because she thought of Siegfried whose life is full of regrets, and Kiana who she has recently improved her relationship with. Kiana unleashed her will, courage, and life to give her name meaning.

She realises that it’s a complicated, hurtful secret… If the timing isn’t right, this truth will not do them any good.

That is to say that, before a truly appropriate day arrives, she could only let them continue to think that Cecilia’s daughter…

…Had died ten years ago.

Yet, this comparatively safe plan has an unpredictable premise…

She can’t tell if Otto will maintain his typical silence during their duel soon to come.

Yet, she knows that she can trust the mature warrior Kiana Kaslana to not be swayed on this matter.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' Okay, let’s assume that all of what you said is true.

'''Durandal:''' What does any of this mean to us? What could it possibly have to do with you and who might benefit from exposing it?

'''Rita (?):''' It means something very simple, Miss Durandal.

'''Rita (?):''' Now that you are here… you must completely unleash the Kaslana Stigmata and use the power to defeat me.

'''Rita (?):''' Even I have no way to get you out.

'''Durandal:''' Hmph.

'''Durandal:''' So, you wouldn’t mind an experiment?

'''Rita (?):''' Experiment?

'''Durandal:''' To test whether or not you can only be defeated with the power of the Stigmata that you speak of.

'''Rita (?):''' Okay. But I must warn you that… what you’re considering… Siegfried Kaslana has tried it countless times.

'''Rita (?):''' Since it’s your first time, I’ll be merciful.

'''Rita (?):''' But in return, I do hope you will stop after a point.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''“Huge Doll”:''' Yes, stop after a point. I don’t want to trigger any horrible defense mechanisms afterall.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' Otherwise, you’ll be buried deeper in the memory by his power.

'''Durandal:''' …You mean Kevin?

'''“Huge Doll”:''' Of course… Since the day he decided to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders… you people have been forced to bear the fate of Kaslana.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' Thus, I was born. As the administrator of the Stigmata, I follow the rules he set and ensure that “salvation” is your glory and “salvation” is your curse.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' Anyway… Only by unleashing the Stigmata, once and for all, can you truly approach him instead of being forgotten in the shadow of his legacy.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' …However, you seem to be a bit different.

'''Durandal:''' …?

'''Theresa (?):''' Siegfried had no other better choices than you? Perhaps you will be different from him.

'''Rita (?):''' Apart from the power of Kaslana, there is something different in you.

'''Durandal:''' …Do you mean, other Stigmata or other forces?

'''Otto (?):''' The latter. It made me hesitate. And it made me take a deeper interest in you.

'''Otto (?):''' It’s like… this memory.

…The owner of the memory is surrounded by warmth. It completely encompasses her body.

It’s like she has just woken up and her mind is filled with a blissful nothingness.

'''Theresa:''' …Ah, she woke up.

'''Siegfried:''' Shh… quiet. She’ll lose her temper if she finds you being noisy.

'''Cecilia:''' It’s okay. Look, she’s smiling, isn’t she?

'''Theresa:''' Hehe, Kiana loves Aunt Theresa the most, don’t you?

'''Siegfried:''' Well… You’re the better one, afterall.

'''Siegfried:''' But why is it that when I speak loudly, she…

'''Theresa:''' You look intimidating and mean, so naturally, you need to be more gentle if you want to be a father. Isn’t that right, Kiana?

'''Siegfried:''' Huh? …Hmmm.

'''Cecilia:''' It’s okay, Siegfried, don’t get upset. When girls grow up, they’re generally close with their Dad.

'''Siegfried:''' I’m not upset, sweetie. The way the kids are these days, I’ll be lucky if she still thinks of me as her father.

'''Theresa:''' Hey, you said you weren’t upset! Kiana, what are we going to do with your old man? Let’s beat him up together, alright?

'''Siegfried:''' Ah… I surrender, I surrender!

'''Cecilia:''' Haha… Your daughter must really love you.

'''Siegfried:''' What kind of love is this?! She only loves to hit me!

'''Theresa:''' That’s good, so she won’t grow up to be a dumb Kaslana.

'''Siegfried:''' Hey… Aren’t you also a Kaslana? Besides, I’m not like a normal Kaslana.

'''Cecilia:''' Pfft. About that, you have to admit that Siegfried is better than us in that regard.

'''Cecilia:''' None of us had the right to choose our own fate, but he was the only one that tried to affirm the meaning of his life in the world, in his own way.

'''Cecilia:''' No one wants their children to repeat their lives exactly… but I hope she will follow in her father’s footsteps on this matter.

'''Theresa:''' Cecilia…

'''Cecilia:''' After becoming a mother, I found that I was proud of the similarities she has to me, but I was also sad about it.

'''Cecilia:''' Proud of her gifts and heritage, sad of the suffering and hurt it may bring her.

'''Cecilia:''' I was once thrilled to find out that the Overseer didn’t think she was special.

'''Cecilia:''' But if she wants to follow a similar path in life to ours when she grows up, I won’t stop her.

'''Cecilia:''' After all… it is her life and she should be the one to decide.

'''Cecilia:''' As long as she is happy, as long as she can create a future for herself…

'''Cecilia:''' Even us, her parents, have no right to interfere with her well thought-out choices.

'''Siegfried:''' I’m not as articulate as Cecilia, but…

'''Siegfried:''' I get the kind of deep trust and attachment she has for us, even though she likes to hit me a lot.

'''Siegfried:''' I… do not want to let down such… a pure and innocent girl.

'''Siegfried:''' I have to help her and provide her with a chance to become a better person. I guess that’s what being a parent is all about.

'''Theresa:''' …Siegfried, it’s amazing that you, a big bruiser of a man, can say something so sensible once in a while.

'''Siegfried:''' Hey… what did you say about me, you little runt?

'''Theresa:''' Heyyyy, who are you calling a runt?!

…The owner of the memory is surrounded by warmth. It completely encompasses her body.

She seems to drift off to sleep again, and her mind is filled with a blissful nothingness.

In the depths of Dreamland, she smiles, crawling like a child across the path woven by the stars. Smiling is indeed a language common to all children.

As the children who are tired from crying fall asleep, a smile shines like a crescent moon on their faces.

They may one day forget how to cry or how to whine… but they will never forget the joy that a smile brings to others.

It is a feeling that has been present since the beginning of humanity.

It departs from the darkness before dawn, riding on the morning breeze to announce the advent of every life.

It returns from the glow after dusk to guard the life of each child by the warmth of the campfire.

A decade later, in the depths of Dreamland, she cozily weaves in between the narrow tarmac alleys of the neighborhood. The fresh air banishes the heavy gloom in her lungs.

It’s June, and wild thistles grow taller than the other weeds lining the weathered stones of the road.

They are purple, thorny, proud and stubborn flowers that can grow unrestrained in the poorest of conditions.

The bees are busy flying between the flowers. She smells her mother’s scent.

Neither knowing when nor where. Perhaps it was all just some kind of strange dream.

But at least in this dream, she is sure that what has been long settled and yet forsaken…

Is sleeping inside her body, much like a time capsule.

The sea swallows play freely in the sky above. She smells her mother’s scent.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' …

'''“Huge Doll”:''' I must admit that this is the least interesting category of memory for me.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' The Kaslana family carries the original Stigmata. You were bound to this family from birth. The so-called “choice” is nothing more than an illusion brought on by an impulse engraved in your instincts.

'''Otto (?):''' Will saving the world really make you happy? What does being a defender of the people bring you?

'''Otto (?):''' You are just living in his great legacy. You abstain from the sweetness of life and partake in the bitter fruit that is this curse.

'''Rita (?):''' Since the day he decided to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders… I have witnessed your repeated fate again and again.

'''Rita (?):''' Each one of you… is following in his footsteps.

'''Rita (?):''' An entire life abandoned for the sake of the world.

'''Rita (?):''' Like… Sisyphus’ hell.

'''Durandal:''' Yet, you chose to feel this memory with me.

'''Theresa (?):''' Because you had a great mother.

'''Theresa (?):''' She might not be the strongest warrior, but she always managed to protect you.

'''Theresa (?):''' She has never left you. She exists in the blood that flows through your body.

'''Durandal:''' My blood…

'''Otto (?):''' Remember what Dr. Otto told you? He said that your Honkai resistance grows with the amount of Honkai energy you are exposed to.

'''Otto (?):''' This is the same power that countless generations have dreamed of. It’s the goal of Project STIGMA and the true purpose of the Holy Blood…

'''Otto (?):''' …To break the boundary between the Imaginary and real, to harness the Honkai and embrace truth in flesh and blood.

'''Rita (?):''' This is a different path from the Herrschers. The Herrschers have long been labeled as Imaginary.

'''Rita (?):''' ICHOR is not able to do this, because it’s just purely inhuman variation.

'''Rita (?):''' Not to mention the ordinary Kaslana or Schariac. Their flesh is simply not in tune with the originality of the world.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' This is something that only you can do. Something that only you can succeed at. This is the original reason I became interested in you.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' The value of your life is far greater than the Kaslana name. That name is marred with numbing, empty, and bothersome tragedy and cannot save the world.

'''Durandal:''' That sounds remarkable, yet are you sure you have everything right?

'''“Huge Doll”:''' …?

'''Durandal:''' You’ve seen so many memories that you have forgotten something crucial.

'''Durandal:''' It may seem to you that there are many people like Siegfried who continue to repeat the fate of their ancestors over and over again yet can never get it right…

'''Durandal:''' But that’s just the outcome of their lives. Regular outcomes don’t have any absolute meaning.

'''“Huge Doll”:''' Saving the world is absolute.

'''Durandal:''' True. Saving the world is not the only thing that has absolute meaning.

'''Durandal:''' …But is a life that never reaches the extreme nothing more than a tiresome story that can be diminished with words like “numb” and “empty?”

'''Durandal:''' Because you are the will of this Stigmata and have the opportunity to see the lives of all of them…

'''Durandal:''' You should not forget that all the memories you have seen belong to living creatures.

'''Durandal:''' They belong to human beings who choose to carry the weight even amidst stress, pain, and despair!

'''Durandal:''' The value of their lives are never as simple as you see them…

'''Durandal:''' Siegfried who regrets his life to this day and Kallen who was hanged with a noose… were their lives pointless and their pasts lacking value?

'''“Huge Doll”:''' …

'''“Huge Doll”:''' You’re trying to convince me that everyone’s life, successful or not, deserves respect.

'''Rita (?):''' But I am the will of this Stigmata. I am a law that has worked the same for 50,000 years…

'''Otto (?):''' If you want to slightly change my perspective…

'''“Durandal”:''' …The first thing you should do is master yourself.

'''???:''' Siegfried Kaslana, fallen prey to his own rashness.

'''???:''' Kallen Kaslana, taken down by her own frailness.

'''???:''' They haven’t been able to connect with their ancestral origin…

'''???:''' Conquer yourself. Leave behind the past.

'''Durandal:''' Perhaps they really did lose themselves at some point.

'''Durandal:''' But it isn’t owing to their weakness, but rather that they were at the front of history.

'''Durandal:''' They left behind signs for those that followed, and legends for themselves.

'''Durandal:''' They were like silent colossi upon whose shoulders we gazed at the future.

'''Durandal:''' Five years prior, during that moment of crisis, I said something similar to my partners…

'''Durandal:''' “For those that I love, for those that they love, for all those who can truly be called human… They made it so I might live as I do now, and I am willing to give everything to keep them safe.”

'''Durandal:''' Compared with the impact of these people… what proof of a hero is a momentary success or failure?

'''Durandal:''' To have once succeeded or failed, is that why they could never win over themselves?

'''Durandal:''' You cannot deny them… not anyone!

With the destruction and dissipation of the illusory body conjured up by the will of the Stigmata, a boundless sense of desolation once again overwhelms all of her senses.

Unlike the other static memories she has experienced before… she senses an ascetic and silent will that is curled up in the depths of the desolation.

As if to respond to her attention, the will stretches out, choosing a corner in this bleakness to allow his form to manifest.

====<u>Gameplay 28-6 - Equinox Rider</u>====
'''“Kevin”:''' We meet again, after six months.

'''Durandal:''' …Yet, you are not him.

'''“Kevin”:''' True, I’m just his shadow, a bubble that stays here to watch over this particular Stigmata.

'''“Kevin”:''' I’m the most basic part that remains after discarding all the external personalities you have seen before.

'''“Kevin”:''' You know what I am going to do next, and I know that about you too.

'''“Kevin”:''' I can’t maintain this state for long, and this is probably the only chance we have to communicate with each other.

'''“Kevin”:''' If you have any questions, ask now.

'''Durandal:''' (Compared to the will from earlier… he is much more frank.)

'''Durandal:''' (This might be a great opportunity for me to get as much critical information as possible.)

'''[CHOICE] =''' About the Kaslana Stigmata

'''Durandal:''' You seemed to keep implying that the Kaslana Stigmata is completely different from other Stigmata.

'''“Kevin”:''' Yes.

'''“Kevin”:''' The Kaslana Stigmata is not just a set of genes passed down from generation to generation. It also includes a series of organelles that originally belonged to that Honkai beast.

'''“Kevin”:''' Just as most plants rely on chloroplasts to carry out photosynthesis, these organelles, which are unique to the Kaslanas, ensure that the Stigmata does not rapidly decay after generations, and ensures that each offspring has the opportunity to awaken to its true power.

'''Durandal:''' Does this mean… that all members of the Kaslana family are not ordinary humans in the biological sense?

'''“Kevin”:''' That depends on what angle you interpret it from. Although it is true, special genes and organelles make your underlying physiological mechanisms quite different from the norm…

'''“Kevin”:''' The mitochondria or chloroplasts of ordinary organisms also originated from certain bacteria that settled in the cells by chance.

'''“Kevin”:''' The Kaslana bloodline is not different from any of them. If you don’t suffer from mysophobia, then there is no need to suddenly feel like you’re some strange, ancient creature.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''[CHOICE] =''' About what Otto wants…

'''Durandal:''' I remember you mentioned that you believed Otto exiled me to this space intentionally.

'''Durandal:''' The topic was avoided at the time… But I’m still concerned about it. What made you think that?

'''“Kevin”:''' He messed up your Genius navigator.

'''“Kevin”:''' You were supposed to come straight here to meet me… but some factor interfered and caused your navigator to lose its original accuracy.

'''Durandal:''' Was it the power of the Holy Blood that you repeatedly mentioned?

'''“Kevin”:''' No. Although the Holy Blood prevented me from meeting you directly, it had nothing to do with the accuracy of the spatial orientation.

'''“Kevin”:''' I mean that your navigator was originally implanted with all sorts of navigational functions, which made Otto unable to make completely precise adjustments to it.

'''“Kevin”:''' For example… Even you carry around two Genii, one new and one old, and they will operate in different ways.

'''Durandal:''' (I see…)

'''Durandal:''' Rita, you actually got me a real set of amulets.)

'''Durandal:''' That is to say that the power of Otto, the power of the Seed of Sumeru, and the power of the Genius…

'''Durandal:''' …Plus your resistance to the Holy Blood created my strange encounter in this space.

'''“Kevin”:''' That’s it in a nutshell. So, back to your question…

'''“Kevin”:''' I think Otto wanted you to fully inherit the power of Kaslana so that it would be even harder for me to interfere with his plans.

'''“Kevin”:''' …It seems that he is trying to probe the Imaginary Tree for some kind of information related to the Kaslanas…

'''“Kevin”:''' I bet he does not want me to get entangled in his plans under any circumstances.

'''Durandal:''' …But fully inheriting the power of Kaslana will only strengthen my resolve to stop his plan.

'''“Kevin”:''' Maybe that’s what he’s up to.

'''Durandal:''' What do you mean?

'''“Kevin”:''' Based on your memory, I’m going to offer a fairly irresponsible assumption…

'''“Kevin”:''' But maybe to him, your actions directed at stopping him from destroying the world give him some kind of purpose.

'''“Kevin”:''' And for this reason he is bent on reconfiguring his base reality as we speak.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''“Kevin”:''' Don’t give me that confused look. As I said, it's just an irresponsible assumption.

'''“Kevin”:''' The proof of this is that… in his heart, he is completely undecided about the state of affairs.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' …

'''[CHOICE] =''' About Stigmata space

'''Durandal:''' At first I thought… that this place was some kind of residue in Imaginary Space, but you said this Stigmata space has its own structure and origin.

'''“Kevin”:''' It’s really all the same thing, just from a different perspective.

'''“Kevin”:''' Stigmata and Stigmata space are just inadequate failures.

'''“Kevin”:''' She tried to use Stigmata to connect human will directly to Imaginary Space, but the results were not as good as expected.

'''“Kevin”:''' That’s why they created Project STIGMA, a plan to trade this failure for the future of civilisation and humanity.

'''“Kevin”:''' As a side effect, only people like you have the opportunity to transcend the ages and witness the brutal yet thriving future.

'''Durandal:''' …We certainly can’t accept being wiped out by the Honkai, but we also can’t accept such a radical plan.

'''“Kevin”:''' I understand, but that is beyond my perception… I’m only the will of this Stigmata, so I won’t oppose any attempt that would be beneficial towards defeating the Honkai. But as for the real him…

'''“Kevin”:''' You need to know that his sympathies may not be in the same time dimension as yours.

'''Durandal:''' …Not in the same time dimension?

'''“Kevin”:''' …

'''“Kevin”:''' Sorry, I can’t offer any more details…

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' …

'''[CHOICE] =''' About the puppet

'''Durandal:''' You can easily switch between other people’s forms, but why are you only able to use that puppet form when switching to Siegfried Kaslana?

'''“Kevin”:''' One reason is that using the state of the personality fragment directly is more convenient for me than drawing on a remembered appearance.

'''“Kevin”:''' And the other is that… you lack clear memories of that man.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''“Kevin”:''' Don’t worry, you’ll have a chance to change this for good.

'''“Kevin”:''' After all, aside from someone from a long time ago… you may be the first human being who is completely immune to the negative effects of Stigmata.

'''Durandal:''' Someone from a long time ago?

'''“Kevin”:''' You don’t know her. Plus, the reasons why both of you are unaffected by Stigmata must be totally different.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''“Kevin”:''' The Schariac’s Holy Blood… is indeed a genetic mutation that will be the pride of a generation.

'''“Kevin”:''' And to you, the man who revived this bloodline, Otto…

'''“Kevin”:''' …Is like the real version of himself. The one who indirectly gave you your gifts and powers.

'''Durandal:''' They are both very complex indeed. I would not want to be an enemy to either of them if I could help it.

'''Durandal:''' But it seems that neither fate nor personal desires allow me to avoid this.

'''“Kevin”:''' It seems that you have come to view them as enemies, but now with simple hatred.

'''“Kevin”:''' That’s good. It’s a perfect attitude for all of you.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''[CHOICE] =''' About you

'''Durandal:''' I heard that the Kaslanas have a family oath that will help them when they are in a desperate situation.

'''Durandal:''' Are you… the family oath?

'''“Kevin”:''' …That depends on how you see it.

'''“Kevin”:''' My job is to help them awaken to the power that lies within the Stigmata.

'''“Kevin”:''' The rest is either because of the Stigmata itself or their own perseverance, as you said.

'''“Kevin”:''' Besides, when accidents happen, the real version of him will come and take over my duties.

'''“Kevin”:''' But that was just to pass the time when he was sealed in the Sea of Quanta on the edge of the world with nothing to do.

'''“Kevin”:''' Now that he’s regained his freedom… I don’t think he’ll have much interest in it anymore.

'''Durandal:''' You mean… he’s abandoned his offspring?

'''“Kevin”:''' …That also depends on how you see it.

'''“Kevin”:''' To him, he was carrying overwhelming guilt, so he chose to stay away from his blood relatives.

'''Durandal:''' Project STIGMA…

'''“Kevin”:''' There may be more to it than that, but I have no way of knowing anything else… After all, I’m not really him.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' I have no more questions.

'''“Kevin”:''' Very well.

'''“Kevin”:''' Then I will stimulate the power of Kaslana that lies dormant within you.

'''“Kevin”:''' The power is far beyond the limits of ordinary humans. To overcome it and harness it… I suggest that you be the best of yourself.

The image of the man instantly dissipated, leaving only a frigid cold eroding the marrow of the young girl’s bones.

“Hector knew the kingdom would eventually fall and Achilles was aware that he was on his way to death.”

“But both of them set out on the battlefield without hesitation.”

The girl concentrates on her mind and feels a predetermined path begin to stretch slowly and solidly beneath her feet, like a frozen river.

Her flesh is like ice, yet her blood is boiling.

The extended path takes her to a dead-end where the is only a voice echoing repeatedly in her head…

“Kill the Honkai.”

Kill the Honkai, kill the Honkai, kill the Honkai…

Kill kill kill kill…

'''Durandal:''' …Uh!

'''???:''' It’s okay, my child.

'''???:''' This is not your sin and you don’t have to carry this responsibility alone.

'''???:''' You can rely on Mummy’s strength for a bit… at a time like this.

'''Durandal:''' …!

Warm blood flows back to her head, and all the madness, that flooded in from all sides, vanishes into thin air.

Although the path still stretches beneath her and the untamed power continues to spill out from her body, unlike her ancestors, she feels that she possesses an additional ability that enables her to truly control this power.

It’s silent yet warm, gentle yet powerful. It prevents her from becoming a vessel to unleash the power of vengeance and it helps her to become a knight who can live up to her long-held destiny.

She knows that it’s a momentary yet eternal embrace given to her by her mother across time.

'''Durandal:''' It seems, Adjudicator, that I have succeeded.

'''“Kevin”:''' No, ye of sin and glory, there is one last step to take.

'''“Kevin”:''' Defeat the blemish of this bloodline and prove that you alone belong to yourself… an entirely new lineage.

With the dancing of the lance, the husk was put to a halt instantly.

The frigidity that engulfed the entire space finally faded away, leaving only personality fragments it previously grasped.

'''Huge Doll:''' …

'''Huge Doll:''' …You passed the trial.

'''Huge Doll:''' You transcended the destiny of salvation and ascended to Equinox as a mere mortal.

'''Durandal:''' …I couldn’t do it alone.

'''Huge Doll:''' I know, but your personal endeavor is not to be overlooked.

'''Huge Doll:''' What is life? Existence that passes on legacy and pushes forward innovation, forever on the path of progress.

'''Durandal:''' So I have the giants whose shoulders I stand on to thank. And…

'''Durandal:''' When these giants become threats to the world… I have to stop them as well.

'''Durandal:''' At least, I need to make sure their transgressions won’t hurt the thriving world of humanity.

'''Huge Doll:''' You don’t need to feel conflicted. Stopping the old generation of willful wrongdoing is exactly the purpose of the new.

'''Huge Doll:''' I’m only a personality fragment of Siegfried, but even I can feel his passion.

'''Huge Doll:''' He is a real man and he has a passionate young heart that never ages.

'''Durandal:''' Your memory… has come back.

'''Huge Doll:''' After all, you passed the trial and reset this space.

'''Huge Doll:''' I’ll return to the real me… by then, our memory won’t be more than a blurred dream to him.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Huge Doll:''' You don’t have to be upset about this…

'''Huge Doll:''' At this fleeting final moment, I have one more obligation to you.

'''Durandal:''' …?

'''Huge Doll:''' This is the depths of Imaginary Space, where magical reactions between spaces occur.

'''Huge Doll:''' Even though all I can do is pass information from the other side to you.

'''Huge Doll:''' Anyway… this is something I have to do for you.

''[CG plays wherein the fragment shows a view of a huge two-pronged tower, bombarded by masses of black ice.'']

'''Huge Doll:''' This is the hell Kevin endures alone, and the final destination place for the real Siegfried.

'''Huge Doll:''' He has been trying to escape from the Stigmata space… but without any hope of awakening, he can only shed personality fragments like me.

'''Huge Doll:''' And Kevin’s choice was to seal him in there… the place where all his sins condense.

'''Siegfried:''' Cecilia… Kiana…

'''Siegfried:''' Why… are you smiling at me?

'''Siegfried:''' I… was the one that got you killed…

'''Durandal:''' Ah…

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' No, Mr. Siegfried! Your daughter… She's alive! She’s here!!

'''Huge Doll:''' It’s one-way communication and he can’t hear us, Durandal.

'''Durandal:''' I… I know.

'''Durandal:''' But I need to tell myself…

'''Durandal:''' One day, I’ll make sure he knows… of all the regrets in his life… that one is just a tasteless joke from fate.

'''Durandal:''' That might be the only consolation I can offer him.

'''Durandal:''' …!

'''Siegfried:''' …

'''Siegfried:''' I seem to have dreamed that dream again.

'''Siegfried:''' Kiana… your sister who adopted your name… I hope she isn’t a disappointment to you.

'''Siegfried:''' Haha… I’ll just pretend someone is listening…

'''Siegfried:''' When I was young, I never thought the Kaslana name carried such a vicious curse. The Stigmata restrictions… this frozen hell…

'''Siegfried:''' Anyway, I believe we’re helping others and defending the weak with a good heart…

'''Siegfried:''' …Saving civilization with a good heart.

'''Siegfried:''' To be honest, if Cecilia and you were still alive… I’d be content to accept anything fate has prepared for me.

'''Siegfried:''' But you… you went away like true Kaslanas…

'''Siegfried:''' Leaving me and her behind.

'''Siegfried:''' So, I must stay strong. There’s not much, but I’ve still got to tell myself…

'''Siegfried:''' I’m getting out of here. I’m returning to the kid and telling her I’m alright.

'''Siegfried:''' …This might be the biggest consolation I can give her now.

'''Siegfried:''' Haha, looks like I have to…

The voice from afar was cut off abruptly. Very soon, the worn but still optimistic face vanished from her sight.

He’s still alive. He still has memories of her. He’s still trying to fight for a way to return to his family.

It was just a glimpse, and he couldn’t feel her existence in any way…

Still, Durandal felt a huge relief.

Not only because he was her father.

Not only because not long ago, she benefited from his teaching.

On top of all these reasons, she felt happy for him, a hero with a life full of regrets.

Happy that he was still breathing.

Happy that his fighting spirit remained.

And perhaps happy that… in her blood, that Kaslana persistence still ran strong.

'''Huge Doll:''' Ah… looks like this is the end for me.

'''Durandal:''' You’re going away?

'''Huge Doll:''' Looks that way. Our ties are becoming weaker and weaker…

'''Huge Doll:''' I’m about to return to the real him, and you’ll be able to return to reality very soon.

'''Huge Doll:''' …I can’t decide anything in his stead.

'''Huge Doll:''' But if I could, I wish to…

'''Huge Doll:''' Safeguard your future path as family.

'''Huge Doll:''' Witness your life bloom to the fullest.

'''Durandal:''' …

The doll was gone.

And the last thing it left for Durandal…

Was a torn but pristine picture.

In the picture were a man and his daughter.

It captured a precious moment of family joy.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' No matter what, Kiana and I are going to find you…

'''Durandal:''' Dad.

The depths of Imaginary Space were silent as night.

Durandal looked up to the starless heavens and tried to take in everything she just experienced.

She knew there was a true battle waiting for her to rejoin…

…But just when she was relocating the Seed of Sumeru using the Genius, a comm request from the outside came in.

It was a frequency Durandal was familiar with from a long time ago, and it reminded her of that fateful journey five years ago.

Slightly surprised, she picked up the receiver.

'''Durandal:''' This is Durandal. Please speak.

'''???:''' Master Durandal!

'''Durandal:''' Rita, is that you?

'''''''''''' Of course! Are you alright? Did you run into any danger?

'''Durandal:''' Ah… I’m fine. Sorry to have worried you.

'''Rita:''' Phew… No, I’m just glad you’re okay.

'''Rita:''' Well, do you need a sitrep from me?

'''Durandal:''' Yes, thank you.

Rita told Durandal what was happening in reality.

'''Durandal:''' The Herrscher of Binding’s power?

'''Durandal:''' Looks like I do need to rush back.

'''???:''' That said, the right timing is also crucial.

Another voice Durandal had long missed came out from the Genius. She was the owner of the frequency who fought side-by-side with the two Valkyries.

'''Durandal:''' Dr. Schrodinger?!

'''Schrodinger:''' Hi. It’s been a while, Bianka.

'''Schrodinger:''' I tried to reach you earlier, but Rita insisted on us keeping it from you longer.

'''Durandal:''' Uh… She was probably worried that Otto would see through me right away.

'''Schrodinger:''' Hehe, your mutual trust is amazing.

'''Schrodinger:''' Alright, back to the topic…

'''Schrodinger:''' The fact that Otto is now wielding the Herrscher of Binding’s power is exactly the reason why the timing of your return matters.

'''Durandal:''' You’re worried I might be blocked by the power on my way back?

'''Rita:''' That’s one of the reasons.

'''Rita:''' On the other hand, from what I learned using the Seed of Sumeru, Theresa might confront the Herrscher of Binding’s power in a special way.

'''Rita:''' …Which is the Zeroth Power of the Oath of Judah.

'''Durandal:''' She’s trying to cancel it out with another force of the same nature?

'''Rita:''' Probably. So you might be subjected to both forces on your way back and be put into greater danger.

'''Durandal:''' But… I can’t stay here.

'''Durandal:''' I’m lucky. I was trapped here, but being here…

'''Durandal:''' Led me to a new power and the knowledge that… No, nothing.

'''Durandal:''' Anyway, I’m obliged to finish the inquisition into the Overseer’s true intent.

'''Durandal:''' It’s my responsibility as a member of Schicksal. This time, it looks like he’s going to deny the whole world the right to exist.

'''Rita:''' …

'''Rita:''' I see, Master Durandal. You’re very convincing…

'''Rita:''' But I do wish you can have faith in Dr. Schrodinger’s judgment.

'''Rita:''' After all, even from the perspective of fighting the Overseer, she’s more determined than the both of us, right?

'''Durandal:''' …You’re right. I’m too hotheaded.

'''Rita:''' It’s alright. I understand your feelings.

'''Rita:''' And precisely because of this…

'''Rita:''' We have a favor to ask… one that only you can help with.
----
===Act 3 - Armageddon===

====<u>Gameplay 28-7 - Armageddon</u>====
…

…Did it work?

With the Nihilus Seed shattered, the gears in the sky vanished, and so did the Herrscher of Binding’s power.

Great…

Her vision began to blur and the whistling of the wind began to dim down.

She wanted to speak, but her lips… no, she couldn’t feel anything now.

Am I… falling?

She couldn’t feel the wind. Only the distancing gears and her hair dancing in the air could remind her of that cold fact.

Kiana… Bronya…

Everyone… is fine…

…

…What’s that?

A sacred light of pure white shot down from the heavens. It didn’t feel menacing at all. On the contrary, it felt… comforting.

In Theresa’s memory, light like this was only seen in one person she knew.

'''Theresa:''' Cecilia…

''[CG plays wherein Durandal catches the falling Theresa:''

'''''Durandal:''' Sorry, I got held back… Theresa.'']

The knight returning from Imaginary Space slowly descended.

The Abyss Flower answered her calling and extended the warm light upward to blanket Theresa’s worn body.

'''Durandal:''' I’m the black from the abyss and the white from the clouds.

'''Durandal:''' I was born before the world was created, and I will live on after the world’s demise.

'''Durandal:''' I shall offer the water from the fountain of life to the thirsty for free.

'''Durandal:''' Divine Key: Abyss Flower, unleash Zeroth Power!

The healing light lit up the night sky, and the hymn of revelation sounded in the ears of the wounded.

Descending from the heavens, Durandal put Theresa gently to rest beside Bronya.

All this seemed so unreal that Seele Vollerei couldn’t even believe her own eyes.

'''Durandal:''' You’re Seele Vollerei, right?

'''Seele:''' Ah, yes. You’re Durandal?

'''Durandal:''' Yeah. Looks like the Abyss Flower accepted you gladly.

'''Seele:''' Ah, I was just trying to save Bronya…

Before Seele finished, Durandal had split the Abyss Flower in half.

'''Durandal:''' It’s alright. The White Flower is meant to save lives, and I hope it can take care of more people in these current circumstances.

'''Durandal:''' Can I count on you to look after Theresa? She was hurt in a unique way, and it takes longer to recover.

'''Seele:''' Yeah… leave it to me.

'''Seele:''' Theresa is the Principal for us all.

'''Durandal:''' …Thanks.

Durandal’s eyes rested on Seele as she cared for the wounded. Someone once told Durandal that the gentlest kid would grow up to be the strongest one.

The White Flower was spreading warm light around, and the Black Abyss was held tight in her hand.

'''Durandal:''' (…In the upcoming battle, all I need is the power of withering.)

'''Durandal:''' (The crisis caused by Schicksal’s retired Overseer… ought to be resolved by Schicksal’s own Valkyries.)

'''Kiana:''' Wait, Durandal.

'''Kiana:''' You just came back without a word, and now you’re going to fight Otto without a word too?

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Kiana:''' I gotta say, I have a lot of scores to settle with Otto.

'''Durandal:''' I know.

'''Kiana:''' Then you should also know what I’m expecting to hear.

'''Durandal:''' …

Durandal was still hesitating.

It wasn’t that she was still holding a grudge against Kiana Kaslana.

It wasn’t that she deemed herself strong enough to solve every problem alone.

It wasn’t that she was worried that the Herrscher before her couldn’t handle herself when confronting Otto.

It slowly came to her that…

All she needed was a little bit more trust.

'''Durandal:''' Thanks.

'''Durandal:''' Let’s fight together, Kiana Kaslana.

'''Kiana:''' Now we’re talking. If you’re worried about the wounded, we still have Seele and more people coming from the Hyperion.

'''Durandal:''' Indeed.

'''Durandal:''' I’ve never met Seele before now… but she seems capable.

'''Kiana:''' Yeah, she can definitely be counted on.

'''Seele:''' Humph, of course we can.

'''Seele:''' But Durandal, the timing of your return is just… too good. And you even changed your outfit?

'''Durandal:''' Haha, looks like some explanation is in order.

Durandal briefly explained how she got in touch with Rita from within Imaginary Space, omitting the parts about the Kaslana bloodline.

'''Seele:''' Alright, it seems like Schicksal is also messed up inside, but this isn’t important…

'''Seele:''' After all, Otto is our common enemy now.

'''Durandal:''' He’s more than a common enemy, but right now, there’s no way but to defeat him.

'''Seele:''' …Do all S-rank Valkyries enjoy talking in riddles?

'''Seele:''' I just said this isn’t important anymore. Can’t you be more straightforward?

'''Kiana:''' Seele, Durandal has her concerns as a Schicksal Valkyrie. We need to be more understanding.

'''Seele:''' …Fine.

'''Durandal:''' It’s alright. We ought to be honest with each other.

'''Seele:''' Uh… you don’t have to mind me. Sorry for my rude speech earlier.

'''Durandal:''' …?

'''Kiana:''' Ahem… let’s keep the discussion about Otto.

'''Kiana:''' According to his confession, he plans to bring the whole world outside Klostern back to five centuries ago before sunrise.

'''Kiana:''' The church has fallen, but he has no intention to reveal himself.

'''Durandal:''' …I believe he’s somewhere inside Imaginary Space.

'''Durandal:''' He seems to be… connected to the Imaginary Tree in a mysterious way.

'''Durandal:''' If he wishes to manipulate the world, he must stay outside it and approach the Imaginary Tree.

'''Kiana:''' Otto said when he was leaving that he’d take over the powers of God one by one.

'''Durandal:''' That’s typical for his speech. Should refer to different Herrscher powers. In that case…

'''Durandal:''' Since you still have the Herrscher of the Void’s power, what he relies on for space manipulation has to be the Cosmic Juggernaut.

'''Kiana:''' Does that mean that if we can find the traces he left when leaving reality, we can follow the trail and pursue him with the Herrscher of the Void’s power?

'''Durandal:''' That;s right. And with you around, I don’t need to be worried about getting lost in Imaginary Space again.

'''Kiana:''' Speaking of that… I’m curious about your new power, Durandal. Does it have any other form?

'''Durandal:''' Huh?

'''Kiana:''' I don’t know how to describe the feeling… it somehow feels familiar.

'''Kiana:''' …Sorry, I know it sounds weird.

'''Durandal:''' …No, you should trust your instincts, Kiana.

'''Durandal:''' Simply put, my new power is connected to the Stigmata I carry…

'''Durandal:''' If you’ve seen a fully awakened Stigmata on someone else, it’s natural for you to have a similar feeling.

'''Kiana:''' …Is that so? Fully awakened Stigmata…

'''Kiana:''' I’ve got to up my game too.

'''Durandal:''' …?

'''Seele:''' Kiana… Your power hasn’t recovered yet?

'''Kiana:''' I’ll never find out before I try.

''[CG plays wherein Kiana begins to manifest her blade.'']

'''Kiana:''' (Worked well.)

'''Kiana:''' (But something is missing if I wish to resume the Flamescion greatsword…)

'''Kiana:''' (Anyway… in my current shape, I still hold a chance against Otto now that he’s lost the power of Binding.)

'''Kiana:''' Looks fine, right? I’m about 70% recovered.

'''Durandal:''' I hope you’re not pushing yourself too hard.

'''Kiana:''' That’s far from ideal, but I’m not playing tough, and I’m not standing idle watching you fight Otto alone.

'''Seele:''' (If only I had enough strength in me now…)

'''Kiana:''' It’s alright. You’ve been a big help already, Seele.

'''Seele:''' Huh?

'''Kiana:''' The look in your eyes already gave you away.

'''Durandal:''' Confronting Otto is dangerous… and guarding the rear is equally important.

'''Seele:''' I know. I just wish… I could do more.

'''Seele:''' Bronya, Theresa, and Fu Hua… they all gave everything they had to even the odds.

'''Seele:''' I wish I could also make a bigger contribution and fight alongside you.

'''Seele:''' But I know… protecting them with my own hands is something I can be proud of already.

'''Durandal:''' Seele…

'''Kiana:''' I told you, she’s tougher than she looks.

'''Durandal:''' Yeah.

'''Durandal:''' Well, we’re leaving the rear to you, Seele.

'''Seele:''' Humph, try not to die out there. Seele would be sad.

'''Durandal:''' Haha. Understood.

'''Kiana:''' Well… I’ll get in touch with the Hyperion for the last time.

Kiana reported the current situation to the Hyperion.

'''Tesla:''' At this stage, we don’t even have a chance to say no now.

'''Einstein:''' Amber is rushing to the church with the Immortal Blades. She should be able to share some of Seele’s burden.

'''Einstein:''' Of course, we’ll also try to collect as much energy and ammo as we can to prepare for battle.

'''Einstein:''' Should there be any need to summon the Hyperion just like when fighting the Herrscher of Domination, we’ll be ready for the teleportation.

'''Nagamitsu:''' I know you have what it takes to defeat Otto and stop his plan! I have great faith in you!

'''Durandal:''' Nagamitsu? I remember you said you’d evacuated to somewhere safe.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Yeah, and I believe the Hyperion to be such a place.

'''Durandal:''' …Alright. Very typical of you.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Sorry to have you worried, Bianka.

'''Durandal:''' …Uh, now is not the time for this.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Ah, I just wish to lighten the mood a little bit.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Now that you’re traveling to Imaginary Space again, should I share with you the findings from the bubble universe linking experiment?

'''Tesla:''' Huh? Hey, you’ve been keeping this from us all along?

'''Nagamitsu:''' Uh, I just never found a good chance to say this.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Listen, Bianka and Kiana…

'''Durandal:''' …?

'''Nagamitsu:''' If Otto somehow established a connection to the Imaginary Tree, he’ll be able to command nearly infinite amounts of Honkai energy.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Of course, he won’t be able to unleash all of it as an individual, but he’d still be nearly impossible to beat.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Anyway, if you run into that dire situation, maybe an experiment result I recorded can be helpful…

'''Durandal:''' Before, when the Holy Blade Durandal linked the bubble universe to the Imaginary Tree, the 2nd Divine Key captured something extraordinary.

'''Nagamitsu:''' At that moment, the two nodes matching finiteness and infinity underwent random property switches.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Which is to say, when the space linked to the Imaginary Tree changes, in the neighboring area…

'''Nagamitsu:''' Certain things that are finite in our eyes turn to be infinite.

'''Nagamitsu:''' And other things that seem infinite in our eyes turn to be finite.

'''Durandal:''' What does that mean? How can the two be switched?

'''Einstein:''' No… this is actually possible in theory.

'''Einstein:''' The imaginary renormalisation… It can be a special exchange defined in Imaginary Space, just as Nagamitsu described.

'''Tesla:''' Yeah, theoretically, there’s a certain mechanism to transform the two opposite statuses… only Anti-Entropy never observed such a thing.

'''Kiana:''' But… how can this abstract idea be useful to us in battle?

'''Nagamitsu:''' As I said before, if you somehow find Otto entering the domain of infinity in some way…

'''Nagamitsu:''' Then maybe you can distort the space around him and push into imaginary renormalisation so he can only return to the finite world.

'''Nagamitsu:''' And for someone with the Herrscher of the Void’s power, it’s not exactly a tall order, right?

'''Kiana:''' I can only try to remember what you said, but…

'''Nagamitsu:''' Yeah, I ask nothing more. Herrschers are known to be miracle workers.

'''Nagamitsu:''' With the right cue in mind, the rest will… just happen naturally, right?

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Tesla:''' Ah, maybe this is her unique way of cheering you on.

'''Tesla:''' Can’t say it’s useless knowledge, but there are too many prerequisites and it’s not really tightly related to our situation.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Ah… you saw right through me… I’ll just repeat my first words!

'''Nagamitsu:''' I know you have what it takes to defeat Otto and stop his plan! I have great faith in you! Goodbye!

Without saying hello to the two Anti-Entropy scientists, this curious Schicksal researcher hung up abruptly.

Probably, on the other side of the screen, Dr. Tesla and Einstein were exchanging the same puzzled look as Kiana, Durandal, and Seele.

'''Durandal:''' …Sorry for this.

'''Seele:''' She is… indeed a very special scientist.

'''Kiana:''' Yeah, maybe she just didn’t want us to be nervous.

'''Kiana:''' But anyway, that ends our preparation. Seele, we’re leaving everything behind to you now.

'''Seele:''' Don’t worry, Kiana. I’ll protect everyone.

'''Seele:''' And… please come back safe and sound.

'''Kiana:''' Yep, it’s a deal!

'''Durandal:''' We will, Seele.

--

====<u>Gameplay 28-8 - Reshape</u>====
'''Kiana:''' Right, Durandal.

'''Durandal:''' What is it?

'''Kiana:''' After opening this door, we’ll settle the score with Otto once and for all.

'''Durandal:''' …Yes

'''Kiana:''' You know he created me in a lab.

'''Kiana:''' He brought me into this world and took me as a test subject and vessel to revive a Herrscher.

'''Kiana:''' Test Subject K423… that’s all the dignity he afforded me.

'''Kiana:''' I was a clean slate and I had no idea why I was born, what I should seek in the world…

'''Kiana:''' It was my Dad who set an example for me and showed me what kindness was. He gave me love and the name Kiana.

'''Kiana:''' And then he was gone.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Kiana:''' I started to drift in the world trying to find him and trying to become someone the weak could depend on.

'''Kiana:''' Just when I thought everything was behind me, Otto showed up again, awakened the Herrscher’s malicious will, and ruined St. Freya.

'''Kiana:''' I could only start drifting again… with the guilt of a Herrscher, the pain of losing a dear teacher, and the self-blame.

'''Kiana:''' That was who I was when I ran into you. Naturally, our first encounter didn’t end well.

'''Kiana:''' So much happened since… and I now understand that the ties between people are sometimes far more complicated than we imagine.

'''Kiana:''' And that’s exactly why I have to ask you this question…

'''Kiana:''' Which identity are you assuming in the fight against Otto?

'''Durandal:''' …That’s a good question.

'''Durandal:''' I can be a tit-for-tat avenger, a rebel against tyranny, or a protector of humanity.

'''Durandal:''' …But I’m not any of these right now. When I face him again, I’d still consider myself a Schicksal Valkyrie.

'''Durandal:''' I know Schicksal is far from perfect, and our work as Valkyries leaves much to be desired.

'''Durandal:''' But that’s why in such a dilemma where everyone is forced to make decisions, I need to take back the right to define Schicksal and Valkyries…

'''Durandal:''' From the willful, conceited Overseer.

'''Durandal:''' Schicksal is a militarised organisation where the chain of command is respected, but this doesn’t mean Schicksal members are simply gears in a war machine.

'''Durandal:''' What is right, what is wrong, and how should Schicksal be defined… one man doesn’t have the say to all of these.

'''Durandal:''' They’re choices put into the hands of every member. They’re a canvas painted by the colorful strokes of everyone’s life.

'''Durandal:''' So, at this moment, I’m taking back the canvas from Otto’s hands with you to make sure everyone can paint on it.

'''Durandal:''' By doing this, I’m also leaving my unique strokes on the canvas as a Valkyrie.

'''Kiana:''' Is this the resolution of Durandal?

'''Durandal:''' It’s the resolution if Bianka Ataegina.

'''Durandal:''' …Otto has changed the course of my life in every way. In a Shakespearean analogy…

'''Durandal:''' He’s not just Julius Caesar or Macbeth… He’s also Claudiius, Othello, and even Hamlet.

'''Durandal:''' He’s a cruelly beautiful and magnificently evil work of art… In the end, we’ll defeat him and history will judge him.

'''Durandal:''' I believe… that’s also his personal wish.

'''Kiana:''' In your heart, he’s still a leader, a man of complexity and conflicts.

'''Durandal:''' Yes. But it won’t stop us from fighting together against him… or even killing him.

'''Kiana:''' Yep, well noted.

'''Kiana:''' So, the strongest Schicksal Valkyrie…

'''Kiana:''' Before we step into the battle together, should we have a high five?

Durandal hesitated briefly on hearing this. She didn’t know Kiana held such a spirited mentality against her fateful foe.

But… yeah, this is the true Kiana Kaslana. This is the daughter of Siegfried and Cecilia.

Something about her never changed, ten years ago or now.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Clap*

The crisp clap spoke loudly of their mutual trust and shared confidence.

I’m leaving my back to you. WIthout even saying this, they understood each other perfectly.

Not that they shared the same motivation. Not that they shared the same sentiment either.

But these were not important…

The important thing was that their paths finally converged on this special day.

The important thing was that the stars bearing their fates were now shining brilliantly together in the heavens.

--

====<u>Gameplay 28-9 - Full of Emptiness</u>====
'''Kiana:''' What’s going on? There’s nothing here?

'''Durandal:''' No. Look over there.

'''Kiana:''' Those are… cracks in reality? Torn by Imaginary Space?

'''Durandal:''' Let’s go and check it out.

'''Kiana:''' …!

'''Durandal:''' Can you perceive the space behind the fracture?

'''Kiana:''' Yeah, I can, and it does feel like the power Otto used before.

'''Kiana:''' Only… if we’re to expand the crack so that we can get through…

'''Durandal:''' Any difficulties?

'''Kiana:''' …I’ll try.

'''Kiana:''' But since it’s Herrscher power, you’d better keep a distance.

'''Durandal:''' Understood.

Durandal took a few steps back to afford Kiana an open space.

Kiana held her breath and tried to exert the Herrscher of the Void’s power onto the unstable fracture.

'''Kiana:''' “Discard all your delusions, and lull your breath…”

'''Kiana:''' “…Clear your mind of every thought and feeling.”

To fight the might on the other side of the crack, Kiana had to apply her Herrscher powers in a controlled direction.

She had tried doing this before in the Herrscher collision experiment not long ago.

Yet this time, her power had dwindled and the subject she tried to control was far more complicated than the Herrscher Core.

She could feel behind the crack, a huge palace had erected, and the Hokai energy in Imaginary Space was all flowing there.

She had to be very careful, otherwise her own power might be overwhelmed and devoured.

'''Kiana:''' (The timing cannot be flawed, and I have to build up as much strength as possible to tear the opening apart…)

'''Kiana:''' (But my current shape doesn’t allow sufficient explosiveness.

'''Kiana:''' …

'''Kiana:''' (…Anyway, I’ve got to push myself over the limit.)

Kiana thus decided to…

Challenge the apex of the Edge of Taixuan.

She strove to cross the mind lake and reach a higher status.

'''Kiana:''' Eminence, the fount of change…

'''Kiana:''' Ugh!

A violent faintness attacked her.

The minute scars left by the power of Binding on her Core now amplified her burden and almost overwhelmed her.

'''Kiana:''' (But I can’t give up here…)

'''Kiana:''' (I’ve got to stop Otto… before he does something crazy to the world…)

'''???:''' Hold on, Kiana.

'''Kiana:''' …!

'''???:''' I can almost help you now.

'''Kiana:''' You…

'''Kiana:''' …Mei?

15 minutes ago, World Serpent base.

'''Mei:''' You know what Otto is up to?

'''Kevin:''' Yes.

'''Mei:''' …

'''Kevin:''' His plan won’t hurt World Serpent, and the same can be said for your once companions. There are even some minor benefits.

'''Mei:''' …You know I won’t just take your word for it.

'''Kiana:''' His plan is already in motion.

'''Kevin:''' It’s too late for you.

'''Mei:''' No, Kevin.

'''Mei:''' Even if we’re running out of time, I’ll still try to confirm the situation in my way.

'''Mei:''' And help my friends.

A powerful magnetic surge flooded over every corner of the base, sending the sophisticated machines to a halt.

Kevin studied Mei’s actions curiously.

'''Kevin:''' You’re going to wreck the whole place.

'''Mei:''' …

'''Kevin:''' Let me bring you somewhere else… where you can unleash your power freely.

With the ending of his words, a spatial crack grew out of thin air in front of Mei.

'''Mei:''' The Sea of Quanta…

'''Kevin:''' You deserve to make a difference, Herrscher of Thunder.

Now…

'''Kiana:''' …Where am I?

'''Kiana:''' Right, I just heard Mei’s voice and she told me to hang on…

A burst of energy fluctuations passed from afar, boiling up every drop of blood in her.

'''Kiana:''' …!

'''Kiana:''' Mei! She’s right ahead!

'''Kiana:''' Mei! We have the strength of a hundred warriors when Mei’s around!

'''Mei:''' A hundred? I’m no ultra woman…

'''Kiana:''' I mean that if Mei’s around, I can feel my power increase a hundredfold!

'''Mei:''' …That’s really something Kiana would say.

'''Kiana:''' …Why did I start thinking about the past? What’s wrong with me?

'''Kiana:''' The Selene… that’s where it all started. It’s been a year already.

'''Kiana:''' Haha, so a year has passed? So much has happened, I thought it was half a decade.

'''Kiana:''' Mei… What’s wrong? …What’d he do to you?

'''Mei:''' Kiana, everything is clear now.

'''Mei:''' …This is my decision. Don’t worry about me.

'''Kiana:''' Unbelievable…

'''Kiana:''' …Is this some kind of joke? …Because I don’t think this is funny!

'''Kiana:''' I’m not letting you join World Serpent!!

'''Kiana:''' I’ll never forget that day.

'''Kiana:''' If I were able to go back to that moment, there’s a million things I’d do just to keep Mei here.

'''Kiana:''' No, even before then. Back to the sweet pepper curry… or even earlier to Arc City. That way, Mei wouldn’t have been so sad.

'''Kiana:''' But then we wouldn’t be where we are now.

'''Himeko:''' I don’t think you need to worry about Mei too much. She’s a good kid, and nothing’s going to change that.

'''Kiana:''' I know, and I trust her. I get it… what’s on her mind.

'''Kiana:''' I just… can’t help thinking about her.

'''Kiana:''' Mei, I’m all ready.

A pure and calm nothingness spread out across the space, like the tranquil sky above the stormy turbulence.

Kiana felt the place was somehow familiar.

'''Kiana:''' This place…

'''Mei:''' Is where our minds can reach each other deep inside our Herrscher Cores.

'''Kiana:''' …

'''Mei:''' …

'''Kiana:''' Am I… dreaming?

'''Mei:''' You won’t believe it if I say yes, would you?

'''Kiana:''' …

'''Kiana:''' Why didn’t you give me a heads-up?

'''Mei:''' …You’re not wearing that jacket.

'''Kiana:''' Huh?

'''Mei:''' You said you’d keep wearing it.

'''Kiana:''' Oh…

'''Mei:''' Haha, just a joke.

'''Mei:''' You’ve changed a lot.

'''Kiana:''' Yeah? Somehow I feel neither of us has changed a bit.

'''Mei:''' …Yeah, you’re right.

'''Kiana:''' …

'''Kiana:''' So… this place… is where you run into memory or soul fragments, right?

'''Mei:''' Kind of. Only… we’re both our true selves.

'''Mei:''' This was created by the Will of the Honkai. I found it accidentally and realised it could be used this way.

'''Kiana:''' The Will of the Honkai? Isn’t that super dangerous?

'''Mei:''' It’s alright, Kiana. It can’t hurt me.

'''Mei:''' …But we can’t stay here forever. You’re confronting Otto, right? How is it going?

'''Kiana:''' The Principal, Bronya, and Fu Hua… they’ve all risked their lives to create an opening for us.

'''Kiana:''' The Anti-Entropy people, Seele, Liliya, Rozaliya, and the Schicksal Valkyries all contributed their share.

'''Kiana:''' Now, Durandal and I are headed for the final battlefield.

'''Kiana:''' This should be the last fight.

'''Mei:''' Durandal? You can trust her.

'''Mei:''' Let me help you in my way too…

'''Kiana:''' This…

'''Mei:''' It’s like the time in the Theater of Domination, right?

'''Mei:''' The Lightning of Conquest… take my strength.

'''Mei:''' No matter how many times your blade shatters, I’ll reforge it for you.

'''Kiana:''' …Thank you, Mei!

'''Mei:''' Alright, time to go now.

'''Kiana:''' …

'''Mei:''' You’re running out of time, aren’t you?

'''Kiana:''' Mei, I…

'''Kiana:''' …

'''Mei:''' It’s fine. I understand, Kiana.

'''Kiana:''' …Yeah.

'''Kiana:''' We’ve got a lot to catch up on. Have to wait till next time now.

'''Kiana:''' The next time, we’ll see each other in person, right?

'''Mei:''' Yeah.

'''Kiana:''' …

'''Kiana:''' Well… goodbye for now. I’ll go get him.

'''Mei:''' …You have to win, Kiana.

'''Kiana:''' Of course.

'''Kiana:''' We have the strength of a hundred when Mei’s around!

'''Mei:''' …

'''Mei:''' Haha!

'''Mei:''' Alright…

'''Mei:''' Then take it, the strength of a hundred people.

''[CG plays wherein purple lightning surges in the clouds above, striking the ground and allowing Kiana to reforge the Flamescion greatsword:''

'''''Kiana:''' Now!''

'''''Kiana:''' Searing slash!'']

'''Kiana:''' Durandal, now!

'''Durandal:''' Got it!

'''Kiana:''' …

'''Kiana:''' (Thank you, Mei.)

''[CG plays wherein we get a zoom in on a tower floating amidst what appears to be Imaginary Space.'']

'''Durandal:''' Kiana, this is for you!

'''Otto:''' Bianka, Kiana, you’re finally here.

'''Otto:''' In the name of Apocalypse, I welcome you both to witness the Revelation.

'''Otto:''' Are you ready?

'''Kiana:''' Let me, Durandal!

'''Durandal:''' Please, Kiana!

'''Otto:''' Domination is exhausted. And Binding is temporarily out of the picture.

'''Otto:''' But they were able to buy me time, and a venue without any disturbances.

'''Otto:''' And now, I transcend Herrschers, and become a God.

'''Otto:''' My heroes! I am so grateful to you.

'''Otto:''' I will never deceive you, nor let you fall into despair.

'''Otto:''' Of course, I respect your dignity too much to turn around and care for you…

'''Otto:''' How to put a stop to this Imaginary authority is something I’ll leave up to you.

'''Otto:''' Good luck, girls.

'''Kiana:''' Look below!

'''Durandal:''' Prepare to land and ready yourself for the upcoming battle!

'''Kiana:''' That’s…

'''Durandal:''' A Nihilus Seed!

'''Otto:''' Hold on. Being the owner of this place… how can you not allow me to pay my respects?

'''Otto:''' Annihilation is back! A star is born…

'''Otto:''' This power belongs neither to mortals nor Herrschers.

'''Otto:''' It is the Imaginary authority’s original form. The incarnation of truth in this world.

'''Otto:''' Come and get a taste of this “false god’s” power.

'''Otto:''' Good luck, heroes.

'''Otto:''' I	‘ve waited for my fall long enough.

'''Kiana:''' Can’t you shut up already?

'''Otto:''' Fair enough.

'''Otto:''' I do get a bit uncomfortable in the limelight sometimes.

'''Otto:''' I see… You two really have grown a lot yet again.

'''Otto:''' Come. This is the authority’s real strength.

'''Otto:''' Heaven and Earth, bow before me!

The space distorted wildly in front of the girls’ eyes.

The church in the void resonated with Otto’s power.

It collapsed in a way no one could understand, and formed a drastically different new shape.

'''Kiana:''' That’s…

'''Durandal:''' So this is what his heart is truly like.

'''Durandal:''' Let’s go. The final fight will be here soon.

'''Durandal:''' Imaginary authority…

'''Durandal:''' If the “Imaginary” itself is destroyed, will that nullify its authority as well?

'''Kiana:''' You mean with the Herrscher of the Void’s power? Nagamitsu mentioned something similar…

'''Kiana:''' Then let’s give it a try.

'''Otto:''' I, who has been baptised by the Imaginary Tree, am now infinite.

'''Otto:''' How do you plan to take down an infinite being… why don’t you show me?

'''Otto:''' Haha, is this how you take down an infinite being?

'''Otto:''' You’ve underestimated the power of a false god.

'''Otto:''' Stigmata, Herrscher…

'''Otto:''' You think these shadows of the Imaginary can be used to surpass a deity?

'''Otto:''' If you can do so, then I’ll gladly see it through with you.

'''Otto:''' Do you girls think me too cruel?

'''Otto:''' Let me show you the meaning of cruel.

'''Otto:''' Anyone that falls should be pushed further down!

'''Durandal:''' You’ve put on quite the show.

'''Otto:''' Shouldn’t you wait until after the performance to say that?

'''Kiana:''' I figured your performance was almost done!

'''Kiana:''' It’s over.

'''Otto:''' It’s not… over yet…

'''Otto:''' It’s no use…

'''Otto:''' As long as this space is bathed in the grace of the Imaginary Tree…

'''Otto:''' My authority will continue to regenerate…

'''Otto:''' You… cannot kill me…

'''Otto:''' This power that cannot be renormalised is absolutely infinite…

'''Otto:''' Merely relying on the Herrscher of the Void…

'''Otto:''' You cannot do it!

'''Durandal:''' Kiana, now!

'''Kiana:''' Let your authority… accompany you to your grave!

'''Kiana:''' Mum… Dad…

'''Kiana:''' Himeko, Fu Hua, Theresa…

'''Kiana:''' This is what you owe every one of them!

Following the explosion caused by the powers of the Void, the false god’s power vanished.

So did Otto’s mindscape, letting the girls return to where they came from.

'''Otto:''' Well done, Bianka, Kiana.

'''Durandal:''' That voice…

'''Kiana:''' Otto?

'''???:''' Fret not, my honored guests.

'''???:''' For a brief moment, you did reverse the rules above the false god, causing my spirit to become a wandering ghost like this.

'''???:''' Very soon, the dust will be settled the way you wish… and before that, I offer my congratulations.

'''???:''' You defeated the powers of Domination and Binding. You stopped me from destroying your history and people.

'''???:''' Of course, my reward is that I can finally wave my life goodbye without any regrets.

'''Durandal:''' …Overseer, we stopped your insane plan.

'''Durandal:''' Now is the time to tell us your true intentions.

'''???:''' Ha… quite persistent of you, Bianka.

'''???:''' What? You still refuse to see me as your enemy even now?

'''Durandal:''' I won’t condone your sins, but I won’t forget how you supported me either.

'''Durandal:''' And until this moment, I still believe…

'''Durandal:''' That deep down, you somehow still have faith in what you taught us.

'''???:''' Ha, you’re a hard one to sway.

'''???:''' Honestly, I started the day wishing everyone would oppose me and condemn me.

'''???:''' Well, the former succeeded, but the latter… not so much.

'''???:''' Ah, should I feel regretful or relieved?

'''???:''' …Anyway, you did best me, and by extension what’s behind me.

'''???:''' This is a remarkable feat. Put the experience to good use and one day you will defeat the Honkai and bring light to your world.

'''???:''' And I… now finally have a chance to do the same to my world. To be exact, I’ll hand over a lost torch back to her.

'''Kiana:''' Her?

'''Durandal:''' Could it be…

'''???:''' Haha, you both know the answer already.

'''???:''' Right… before you broke me into pieces, I appeared close to godhood, but I was no more than a slave to the Imaginary Tree.

'''???:''' I was tied closely to the base world. I had the power to reshape it, but had no freedom.

'''???:''' So I placed this bet at the very beginning.

'''???:''' I bet that the human mind can create miracles and, for a brief second, disturb the laws of the Imaginary Tree.

'''???:''' Kiana Kaslana. I used to call you K423. With the power of love, you showed me this could be achieved.

'''???:''' Now, I’ve proven anger can achieve the same.

'''???:''' The stake is my last hope of reviving Kallen… and I did win.

'''???:''' The miracle that could only come from the Herrscher of the Void, the renormalisation of Imaginary Space, and the meaning of infinity and stasis.

'''???:''' You drove the world’s wedge, the ground zero of my choice, deep into new soil where it could take roots and sprout.

'''???:''' That’s something I could never have achieved as a slave.

'''Durandal:''' You’re saying that… to reshape the world five centuries ago, you needed to transcend reality and become a part of the Imaginary Tree…

'''Durandal:''' And to change the world and her destiny, you had to exile yourself even if it meant your death and the end of your existence?

'''???:''' Of course. This is a win-win situation for us both.

'''???:''' Just like Prometheus who stole fire…

'''???:''' At that miraculous moment, I successfully brought the power to exceed reality from the Imaginary Tree to the world’s wedge.

'''???:''' It made history branch out into a new path without destroying the world you know and love.

'''???:''' The latter matters very little to me, but…

'''???:''' Thank you for enabling me to witness a miracle that belongs to her and me at my final hour.

'''???:''' In the end, I’ll die with my own sins, and for you who choose to march on…

'''???:''' The long stairs leading to the defeat of the Honkai have revealed the first part. It’s a treacherous road ahead…

'''???:''' But in the end, you’ll find light.

'''???:''' Farewell, heroes.

'''???:''' Tell Theresa… her Grandpa won’t be able to attend her coronation.

…

Otto vanished from the sight of the two girls.

His soul drifted afar, to the great void and to the final destination.

--

====<u>Gameplay 28-10 - Beyond Will</u>====
'''Otto:''' Life… truly is a fragile thing.

'''Otto:''' As a child, my sister died in battle…

'''Otto:''' They told me her soul could never be extinguished.

'''Otto:''' Her spirit rose to the heavens.

'''Otto:''' Generation after generation, humanity is happy deceiving themselves with these lies.

'''Otto:''' Belief in a coming world, in the eternity of consciousness.

'''Otto:''' They looked at the mortal world as though death did not exist…

'''Otto:''' Until death rears its ugly head in their lives, taking the ones they love.

'''Otto:''' And even then, they only deceive themselves further…

'''Otto:''' Believing that love can transcend the physical, that it can last forever.

'''Otto:''' Indeed… love, the entire spectrum of emotion, these can bring about miracles…

'''Otto:''' But only the living can cause miracles…

'''Otto:''' As an ordinary man once deceived by such lies…

'''Otto:''' I too once fantasised that the soul existed on a higher plane, dreaming of the day when the one I loved might take on a new form and return to this world, living in a better future.

'''Otto:''' But that’s not how the world is…

'''Otto:''' Death is the end of consciousness, of everything…

'''Otto:''' We cannot put back together the pieces of a shattered star.

'''Otto:''' Unless…

'''Otto:''' We turn back time only to awaken the island of silent graves, using the rejuvenating water of life to reinvigorate the past that buries all.

'''Otto:''' There the road will fork in two.

'''Otto:''' To choose life or death, from this is born two worlds.

'''Otto:''' And the cost… the death of one person…

'''Otto:''' …And the Honkai which was meant to kill us.

'''Otto:''' It’s such a pity that when I realised this, Otto Apocalypse had already become infamous as a villain worldwide, had already become hated by the very power he needed most.

'''Otto:''' But it doesn't matter. She already proved that.

'''Otto:''' An angel brought about by love has the same strength as love itself.

'''Otto:''' And behind such a hero…

'''Otto:''' Theresa, my dearest granddaughter…

'''Otto:''' You are growing up to be a great leader…

'''Otto:''' In time, you will cause people to forget all about your Grandpa.

'''Otto:''' Let his rights and wrongs be lost in the sands of time.

'''Otto:''' Only…

'''Otto:''' Have a bite of something other than bitter melon once in a while.

'''Otto:''' You’re always staying up late, your body needs nutrients.

'''Otto:''' You know… your Grandpa sewed the Overseer’s coat by hand for tomorrow’s coronation…

'''Otto:''' If you think it looks good, you can use it as your usher in the new era, as you wash clean the sins of your Grandpa.

'''Theresa:''' …Theresa.

'''Otto:''' My old friends, Master Phoenix, the Herrscher of Reason…

'''Otto:''' These are good people, they will help you along your path.

'''Otto:''' And Bianka, my last student…

'''Otto:''' I manipulated your life, planned your destiny, both lovingly bringing you up while using you as a pawn of my own design.

'''Otto:''' You know… everything I’ve shown you these last ten years…

'''Otto:''' Was so that after this Nirvana, someone might put up a monument without words for me.

'''Otto:''' I don’t need people to judge me.

'''Otto:''' After all, this so very long yet incredibly short 500 years… is all a man, a man after his own wishes, can give.

'''Otto:''' And now, he is at his journey’s end…

'''Otto:''' What he had wished to accomplish, to achieve, to redeem…

'''Otto:''' These things have already taken root within the Imaginary Tree.

'''Otto:''' Just waiting for the lost envoy to deliver that final message before it is all over.

'''Otto:''' That moment, neither too soon nor too late, will serve as a requiem that goes beyond death, a hymn of miracles yet to come.

'''Otto:''' At that moment, the world will turn around one person…

'''Otto:''' Cause the sins imposed to scatter, cause the will that has met its end to move on.

'''Otto:''' Such meanness, I take with me to the grave…

'''Otto:''' And light, it stretches into the future because of you.

'''Otto:''' …

'''Otto:''' I have fooled my friends, I have fooled my loved ones, and have fooled the world and the rules that govern it…

'''Otto:''' Just to give to you your true self.

'''Otto:''' A second life.

'''Otto:''' I’m coming home…

'''Otto:''' Kallen.

Wind was blowing through halted time.

Otto was gone, but his final words still echoed long in the wind.

'''???:''' …That’s the story. I traveled to the distant future and experienced the impossible to have a chance to tell you the truth about the world.

'''???:''' Don’t worry. Everything will be different this time because of you.

'''???:''' Just like how very long ago, you changed the life of a certain teen.

'''???:''' It was a spring morning…

'''???:''' He was a sickly boy without any friends, and he ran into you, who got across the wall.

'''???:''' You said hello to him and asked him to play along.

'''???:''' At that very moment…

'''???:''' The boy received his lifelong salvation.

===Act 4 - Afterword===

====<u>Gameplay 28-11 - A New Peace</u>====
After a few cloudy and rainy days, sunlight finally penetrated the clouds and cast down onto Klostern.

With the battle marks washed away by rain, tranquility returned to the old town, as if nothing had happened.

'''Theresa:''' (Phew… the meeting is finally over.)

'''Theresa:''' (Next, I’m seeing Nagamitsu… It’s still early and I don’t have to rush.)

'''Theresa:''' (…)

'''Theresa:''' (The past few days have been crazy. I can’t even tell what day today is.)

'''Theresa:''' (Schicksal HQ is still functioning normally, and everyone is at their post… just busier.)

'''Theresa:''' (It feels like a dream… what happened recently.)

'''Theresa:''' (The signature on the old files, the study in the old HQ, the picture hung on the wall… every time I see them…)

'''Theresa:''' (It feels like one of my nerves is twitching.)

'''Theresa:''' (I don’t know why, but all this feels unreal.)

'''Theresa:''' (Just like the day he announced his retirement to the world.)

'''Theresa:''' …

'''Theresa:''' (No…)

'''Theresa:''' (What am I thinking? Grandpa is indeed…)

'''Theresa:''' (Ah, darn it, I should have turned right. Gotta take a detour now.)

'''???:''' Master Theresa.

'''Theresa:''' Is it Amber? Guess I’ll go talk to her.

'''Amber:''' Master Theresa, how did the meeting go?

'''Theresa:''' Yeah, everything on the agenda was taken care of.

'''Theresa:''' Don’t worry, just some routine work.

'''Theresa:''' But why are you here, Amber?

'''Theresa:''' I thought you’d be staying in the old study sorting out documents.

'''Amber:''' All done.

'''Theresa:''' Haha… that’s the Amber I know.

'''Theresa:''' Anyway, thank you for your work. I’d be in a great mess if not for your help with the files Grandpa left behind.

'''Amber:''' It’s my pleasure.

'''Theresa:''' …Honestly, I’m very curious how you managed to finish such a daunting amount of work in no time.

'''Amber:''' Huh? Guess it’s just experience. I’ve been dealing with them all along.

'''Amber:''' I’d usually have a rough estimation and prioritise different tasks. I’d work overtime if need be.

'''Theresa:''' So you were working overtime…

'''Theresa:''' You need to take better care of yourself and rest more.

'''Amber:''' Master Theresa, did you forget? I’m a bionic, and I don’t ever feel tired.

'''Theresa:''' But still, you can’t work all day without any rest. Even a machine needs greasing once in a while.

'''Amber:''' Well noted. But I believe you’re the one that needs rest the most.

'''Amber:''' There are more reports that need reassessment than before… I saw you thinking hard on the balcony several late nights.

'''Theresa:''' Huh? I didn’t know you noticed.

'''Amber:''' Just a habit. I used to take a look whenever I walked past the study.

'''Amber:''' Master Otto used to work overnight all the time, and get me up to make preparations.

'''Theresa:''' Everything else aside, he was a hard worker.

'''Amber:''' And so are you.

'''Theresa:''' …

'''Theresa:''' I bet he handled the work much easier than me.

'''Theresa:''' I can only try to do as much as possible before I leave the town.

'''Theresa:''' After all, the Hyperion will return tomorrow, and I’ll have to count on Rita and you for administrative affairs.

'''Amber:''' Huh? The day of return… ah, it is indeed tomorrow. Time really flies.

'''Theresa:''' Yeah, especially when you get busy.

They fell silent all of a sudden and looked to the familiar road junction.

The buildings by the road had their colors faded, but the trees grew much taller than before.

'''Theresa:''' If circumstances allow, try to give everyone a vacation after the busy period is over, Amber.

'''Amber:''' Alright, I’ll see to it.

'''Amber:''' …Right, Master Theresa, you’re not in a hurry, are you?

'''Theresa:''' No, I just need to see Nagamitsu later.

'''Amber:''' Huh? You’re seeing her too?

'''Theresa:''' Yeah, she called and said she had something important to announce, but the time’s still early, and there’s no rush.

'''Amber:''' That’s what she told me… I was taking the time before the appointment to take a look around the town.

'''Amber:''' You should have noticed that Klostern is a lot more lively than before.

'''Amber:''' It’s rare to see you not busy. How about you join me to walk around the town before the Hyperion’s return?

'''Theresa:''' Sure. Just occurred to me that I’ve paid almost no attention to the changes in this town.

'''Theresa:''' Seems like a lot of commotion over there. C’mon Amber, let’s go check it out.

'''Theresa:''' I remember this used to be a bookstore. When did it become a souvenir store?

'''Amber:''' Probably a few years back.

'''Amber:''' After Shcicksal HQ was relocated to the Floating Isles, Klostern tried to redevelop into a tourist destination, but it didn’t work well.

'''Theresa:''' Thinking back on it now, we can’t say the redevelopment plan was a bad one.

The once vacant town square is now bustling with tourists and every local souvenir store is sold out.

People seem to have grown an intense interest in this town overnight.

'''Theresa:''' (Grandpa probably never expected his retirement announcement brought such an opportunity to the town…)

'''???:''' Don’t worry, the souvenirs will be restocked soon. Please stay in the line…

'''Man:''' We’ve been waiting here for half a day now, and nothing is getting restocked!

'''Woman:''' Yeah, how long do you plan to keep us waiting?

'''???:''' Ah… we’re very sorry about this! Please have more patience.

'''Theresa:''' The Valkyrie trying hard to maintain order… that’s Susannah, right? She seems overwhelmed by the crowd…

'''Theresa:''' Ah, I’ve got a bad feeling about this…

'''Theresa:''' Hi, Susannah. What’s going on?

'''Susannah:''' Great, it’s Master Theresa! Huh? Master Amber is here too… Sorry, I’m doing my best to solve the problem. Just another minute…

'''Theresa:''' Calm down. What happened?

'''Susannah:''' Uh… we lost a box of souvenirs. The clerk said it was probably left behind on the way of transportation.

'''Susannah:''' I looked around and found nothing…

'''Susannah:''' The store is understaffed and the tourists are getting excited. We can’t send anyone to look for it…

'''Theresa:''' This conversation feels all too familiar…

'''Theresa:''' You stay here and keep the order. I’ll go look for it.

'''Susannah:''' Huh? No no no, I can manage it myself!

'''Susannah:''' Asking Master Theresa to do my job would put a serious question mark on my professionalism!

'''Susannah:''' I’d look very bad on the year-end performance review…

'''Theresa:''' (I’m used to it already…)

'''Theresa:''' Don’t worry, this should be the last time. And your review won’t look bad because of this. Right, Amber?

'''Amber:''' Yes, judging from current circumstances, Susannah does need some support.

'''Susannah:''' Rea… Really? Thanks a million, Master Theresa!

'''Susannah:''' It’s a cubic wooden box… about this big… with “Klostern Souvenir Store” printed on it.

'''Theresa:''' I see. I’ll come back as soon as I find it, but before that, try to comfort the tourists.

'''Susannah:''' Aye, Master Theresa!

'''Theresa:''' This wooden box has “Klostern Souvenir Store” printed on it. This must be the one, right?

'''Theresa:''' Oh no, the box looks pretty empty. The souvenirs must be around nearby.

'''Theresa:''' Let’s keep looking.

'''Theresa:''' “Blessed Mask: Original”…

'''Theresa:''' Isn’t this the mask worn by the Otto clones? There’s even a description on the package…

'''Theresa:''' “…No one knows how these masks came to be.”

'''Theresa:''' …That’s just absurd!

'''Amber:''' I found some souvenirs scattered around too. Overseer Theresa Doll, Overseer Theresa Emblem, Mini Overseer Theresa…

'''Theresa:''' Wha… What are these?

'''Theresa:''' Ahem… anyway, let’s put them back together.

'''Theresa:''' The box is full, there shouldn’t be anything missing.

'''Theresa:''' Let’s head back.

'''Theresa:''' Here, these should be all of them.

'''Susannah:''' Ah, yeah! I’m saved…

'''Susannah:''' I can’t thank you enough… Master Theresa, I promise this is the last time!

'''Theresa:''' Alright, give the souvenirs to the tourists before they start a riot.

'''Susannah:''' Aye!

'''Curious Tourist:''' Hey, look there, that seems to be… Master Theresa Apocalypse!

'''Theresa:''' …!

'''Excited Tourist:''' That’s her! The heir to the throne. I heard it on the news.

'''Curious Tourist:''' But I heard it through the grapevine that she turned down the throne and has other plans…

'''Calm Tourist:''' Yeah, Schicksal hasn’t held the coronation ceremony till today. Maybe…

'''Excited Tourist:''' Anyway, Master Theresa is just here with us now!

'''Jolly Tourist:''' Master Theresa, can I get a picture?

'''Curious Tourist:''' Master Theresa, signature please!

'''Excited Tourist:''' Master Theresa, I’m your biggest fan!

'''Theresa:''' Ah… sorry…

'''Excited Tourist:''' Master Theresa! Master Theresa!

'''Amber:''' More tourists are coming! Master Theresa, we’d better get out of here.

'''Theresa:''' That is if we can… Huh?

With a slap sound, confetti rained down from above. Standing on a stack of crates, Susannah raised the souvenir in her hand high.

'''Susannah:''' Dear customers! New souvenirs are in stock now!

'''Susannah:''' The long wait wasn’t for nothing.

'''Susannah:''' Now we’re running a flash deal. Buy Mini Overseer Theresa and get Super Overseer Theresa Giant for free! 50 only!

The tourists’ attention was instantly diverted to Susannah, who winked at Theresa urging her to leave.

'''Theresa:''' Let’s go, Amber… Susannah has it covered.

'''Theresa:''' Phew… finally got out.

'''Theresa:''' The rumors are just insane. I never said I’d turn down the throne.

'''Amber:''' Haha, in people’s minds, it’s not proper succession without a grand coronation ceremony.

'''Amber:''' I understand your decision… but if you wish, we can still hold a coronation ceremony.

'''Amber:''' By then, the rumors will all go away.

'''Theresa:''' Ah… Amber, spare me this.

'''Theresa:''' I’m in no position for a coronation right now. Technically speaking, I’m still the head of the independent Far East Branch.

'''Theresa:''' I can’t take over the Schicksal system yet, nor can I handle the press as masterfully as Grandpa.

'''Theresa:''' In all fairness, I’m not the Overseer everyone expects, and it’s against my wishes to follow Grandpa’s model.

'''Amber:''' I understand. You will become a different Overseer.

'''Theresa:''' I wanna play down the Schicksal Overseer stereotype and become more of a backstage supporter.

'''Theresa:''' In the future, I wish people would take Schicksal as a well-trained and trustworthy group instead of the Overseer and her followers.

'''Amber:''' Master Theresa, maybe you haven't realised it yourself, but you’ve actually begun to think as an Overseer in your own way.

'''Theresa:''' Drop it, Amber. The Overseer in your eyes was still burning the late night oil to get things done yesterday.

'''Theresa:''' And the Far East Branch still needs my personal involvement for a lot of things… Good thing the HQ is settling down.

'''Amber:''' Don’t worry, Master Theresa, I’ll try to keep things in order at the HQ. And I must add that Schicksal is used to the absence of its Overseer now.

'''Theresa:''' Of course, you need to rest more and stop working over 20 hours a day. This is not an example I wish others to follow.

'''Amber:''' Okay, Master Theresa. I’ll talk with Master Durandal and Master Rita about how we can improve our efficiency.

'''Theresa:''' Alright, to avoid another commotion, we should go somewhere quieter.

'''Theresa:''' Hey, wait…

'''Theresa:''' The old man ahead seems to be in need. Let’s get there and help him.

'''Theresa:''' Sir, the ramp is a little bit steep. Let me help you.

'''Elderly Man:''' Hehehe, look, what a warmhearted little girl. Why haven’t I seen you around town before?

'''Theresa:''' I’m Theresa. We met before when we were evacuating the local townspeople.

'''Elderly Man:''' Oh, I remember now. You came to my house this morning to borrow some flour, right?

'''Elderly Man:''' If you still need more flour, go to the town square and find my son. Sugar, oil… his grocery store has everything!

'''Elderly Man:''' Go back and tell your Mum, they’ve been helping us non-stop these days and we have to thank them properly!

'''Theresa:''' (Seems like this old man has mistaken me for someone else.)

'''Elderly Man:''' Little sunshine, I heard that Overseer Otto hasn’t been seen for quite a few days. Do you know where he’s gone?

'''Theresa:''' He…

After a moment of hesitation, Theresa smiled to the elder.

'''Theresa:''' He retired to travel around the world and won’t come back.

'''Elderly Man:''' What? He won’t be back?

'''Elderly Man:''' Do we have a new Overseer? Folks say it’s someone called Teri or something. Why haven’t we heard more about it?

'''Elderly Man:''' Ah, the slope is this steep and we don’t even know who the new Overseer is. Will there be someone to take care of us?

'''Theresa:''' (The roads here have been out of maintenance for too long. I should try to improve the infrastructure.)

'''Theresa:''' Sir, don’t worry, we’ll find a way to help you.

'''Elderly Man:''' Have dinner? I appreciate it, but I’ve still got things to do. I’ll come by yours later.

'''Elderly Man:''' I need to return this to that girl. She was in such a rush she didn’t know she dropped this.

The old man took out a purse from his pocket.

'''Amber:''' Huh? This purse looks familiar.

'''Theresa:''' Does it belong to a Valkyrie?

'''Amber:''' …If my memory’s correct, it should be Master Sushang’s.

'''Theresa:''' Well, that makes it easy.

'''Theresa:''' Sir, would you like me to help return it?

'''Elderly Man:''' No, I’ve no time for dinner. I have to catch up to her.

'''Theresa:''' I’ll help you return it!

'''Elderly Man:''' Oh, that’s for the best. She’s right ahead, and you can surely catch up if you run fast.

'''Theresa:''' Don’t worry, sir, I’ll make sure she gets it.

'''Theresa:''' Hi, Li Sushang, is this yours?

'''Li Sushang:''' Ah, yeah, I was just looking for it!

'''Li Sushang:''' Thanks. I owe you another one. Guess it got feet and ran out of my pocket on the way.

'''Theresa:''' No need to thank me. An old man picked it up and asked me to return it.

'''Li Sushang:''' Ah, then please thank him for me. I won’t be going back.

'''Amber:''' Master Sushang… you’ve made up your mind to leave?

'''Li Sushang:''' Yeah. I’ll be all rusty if I don’t get going now.

'''Amber:''' Would you like someone to accompany you?

'''Li Sushang:''' No thanks. I’ve no idea where I’m going. I’m better alone.

'''Li Sushang:''' Right, people in the town say they travel in a very long car. Have you seen it?

'''Theresa:''' You mean the train?

'''Theresa:''' It’s formed by many rectangular carriages that run on the railway. Slower than a place, but you can enjoy the view better.

'''Li Sushang:''' Yeah, right, that’s it. Okay, it’s decided. I’m taking the train at the station!

'''Theresa:''' Ah, if you’re going to the Vienna Central Station, you need to take the subway first, a train that runs underground. That way is faster.

'''Theresa:''' But… be it subway or train, you need to decide your destination first.

'''Li Sushang:''' I can’t make the decision yet, but I believe it’ll come to me naturally.

'''Li Sushang:''' I heard there was something called the Shenzhou Express. Sounds nice to travel all the way back home.

'''Amber:''' When do you plan to return, Master Sushang?

'''Li Sushang:''' Dunno. Guess it depends on my mood.

'''Amber:''' …Forgive me for asking this, but are you not comfortable staying at the HQ?

'''Li Sushang:''' No no no. Why is everyone asking the same question?

'''Li Sushang:''' Life here is pretty cozy, and everyone is nice. I’ve had a good time. It’s just…

'''Li Sushang:''' You see the clouds up there? They gather together this moment and drift away the next. People are the same.

'''Li Sushang:''' I’ve kept my word to the Raksha, and I don’t have a plan as to what I’ll do later.

'''Li Sushang:''' Guess I’ll just drift around and see the world first. Time has changed, but I haven’t.

'''Li Sushang:''' Bianka gave me a book as a farewell gift, But I haven’t seen a page of it yet. Here, this one.

'''Theresa:''' (The Two Gentlemen of Verona… a work of Shakespeare. Looks like it was never touched.)

'''Li Sushang:''' Ah, speaking of gifts, I’ve a favor to ask. Can you please give this box of dessert to Master Phoenix?

Li Sushang handed out a box of dessert. Probably the closest to Shenzhou delicacies she could find in Klostern.

'''Li Sushang:''' Oh, she’s called Fu Hua right now.

'''Theresa:''' Sure. But wouldn’t it be better if you give this to her yourself?

'''Li Sushang:''' Nah, she’s started her new life and I’d better not disturb her.

'''Li Sushang:''' Fate shall bring us together again if it’s intended.

'''Li Sushang:''' …Oh, it seems to be the first time we’re talking like this, right?

'''Theresa:''' Yeah, that’s true.

'''Li Sushang:''' Everyone says that the Raksha’s granddaughter is nothing like him, and I can’t agree more. You’re a lot nicer, maybe we can be friends.

'''Li Sushang:''' Shame we don’t have more time, and I’ve got to hit the road. Amber, Theresa, until next time.

Li Sushang waved them goodbye and walked into the dusk.

'''Theresa:''' She’s alone… is everything alright?

'''Amber:''' Master Sushang does things her own way. It’s like she said, the path forward comes naturally.

'''Theresa:''' Let’s bring her gift back to the Hyperion. Only issue is… we don’t know if Fu Hua is on board right now.

'''Amiao:''' Wow, it’s big sis Theresa and big sis Amber!

'''Theresa:''' Hi, Amiao. Why are you carrying all this food on your own?

'''Amiao:''' We’re running out of butter and milk, and I’m helping Mum and Dad.

'''Theresa:''' Good girl. You’re a big help to Mum and Dad now.

'''Amiao:''' Hehe, at first I was afraid to walk this far, but Mum told me there were lots of good ladies like big sis Amber watching out for us, and I’m not afraid now.

'''Amiao:''' But… Big sis Theresa, are you leaving us? Mum and Dad said the big ship would take off tomorrow.

'''Theresa:''' Yes.

'''Amiao:''' Can’t you just stay here?

'''Amiao:''' After you came, the town became busy, and the street lights were all on at night.

'''Amiao:''' If you stay, this place will become even better, like a fun fair!

'''Amiao:''' I wish we can get lots of visitors and fun events every day. Oh, right, and lots of candy!

'''Theresa:''' Amiao…

'''Amiao:''' Ah, but Mum also said you’ve all got important work to do.

'''Amiao:''' There are many more places out there that need people to make them better.

'''Amiao:''' So, don’t worry about us here and go turn the whole world into a fun fair! I’ll watch the news every day and be a good girl!

'''Theresa:''' Thank you. I’ll work hard to make it happen.

'''Theresa:''' Right, you bought food and balloons for a party?

'''Amiao:''' Hehe, it’s a secret! Mum and Dad said it was a gift for you, and we’ll keep it a secret for now.

'''Amiao:''' The orange balloon floated into the tree, and big sis Fu Hua helped me get it back.

'''Theresa:''' Fu Hua? Which way did she go?

'''Amiao:''' That way.

Amiao pointed backwards.

'''Theresa:''' Thank you, Amiao.

'''Theresa:''' Come on, Amber, let’s take the gift to Fu Hua.

'''Amber:''' Ah, wait, Master Theresa.

'''Amber:''' …I think I’d better walk Amiao home.

'''Theresa:''' Huh? Alright, it’s a safe town now, but still, she shouldn’t be left unattended.

'''Amber:''' Yes. Just like what you said, it’s something…

'''Amber:''' No one arranged for me. It’s not official business either. Just something I’d like to do.

'''Theresa:''' Great. Then… Amiao and Amber, catch you later.

'''Amiao:''' Bye, big sis Theresa.

'''Theresa:''' I see…. Amber’s changed too then. Very solid for something so small.

'''Theresa:''' After I give Fu Hua her gift, I’ll go meet with Nagamitsu.

'''Fu Hua:''' Principal, you’re looking for me?

'''Theresa:''' Ah… not something important. Here, take this.

'''Fu Hua:''' A candy box?

'''Theresa:''' I ran into Li Sushang earlier and she asked me to give you this.

'''Fu Hua:''' Where is she now?

'''Theresa:''' She was leaving the town and going to see the world. Should be on the subway now.

'''Theresa:''' …I wonder if she’s learned how to use smartphones and credit cards.

'''Theresa:''' She said she’d take a train and enjoy the view, but she didn’t have any destination in mind. Is she really okay?

'''Fu Hua:''' Haha, don’t worry, Principal.

'''Fu Hua:''' As a martial artist, she has been roaming the land for long… and she adapts to new situations better than you’d expect.

'''Fu Hua:''' For people like her, life is a long journey and the important thing is to meet new people and try new things.

'''Fu Hua:''' In comparison, the destination isn’t necessarily important.

'''Theresa:''' Uh… that’s a very free soul.

'''Fu Hua:''' Yeah, everyone has a different way of life.

'''Fu Hua:''' Thank you for your hard work these days, Principal.

'''Theresa:''' It’s nothing. I just did what I could.

'''Theresa:''' Both the Anti-Entropy doctors and Schicksal’s Immortal Blades have been very helpful through this difficult time.

'''Theresa:''' We may not always see eye to eye, but when it comes to fighting the Honkai, there’s a lot of common ground for us.

'''Theresa:''' And… my real concern is World Serpent.

'''Theresa:''' Kevin seems to have contacted Otto early on, but World Serpent stopped neither us nor Otto.

'''Theresa:''' This isn’t their style, unless…

'''Fu Hua:''' Unless World Serpent… no, Kevin… is waiting for something.

'''Theresa:''' My thoughts exactly. World Serpent stayed out of it, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have a plan. Maybe their plan is well underway.

'''Fu Hua:''' Yes, Kevin has been quiet for quite some time… this probably means he now has good knowledge of the world today and strong confidence in his plan.

'''Fu Hua:''' Project STIGMA… maybe its manifestation will appear drastically different from what we experienced in Arc City and Nagazora.

'''Theresa:''' Which is to say, we’re starting to dive deep into it now.

Fu Hua nodded.

'''Fu Hua:''' We stopped Otto’s destructive plan, but many mysteries still remain unsolved.

'''Fu Hua:''' Otto claimed to have transcended Herrschers. Can we take his words literally? Has what he did changed everything we know about Herrschers?

'''Fu Hua:''' The bottom line is, we still need time to theorise, deduct, and verify the true origin of Herrschers in our time.

'''Theresa:''' I feel like… we just took over a giant mess from Grandpa… uh, Otto.

'''Theresa:''' …Honestly, I’m more confused than before as to what to call him.

'''Theresa:''' Should I call him Grandpa just like before, or Otto like everyone does? They both feel right and wrong.

'''Fu Hua:''' …The ties between people cannot be defined by a simple word. Principal, you need only to follow the voice in your mind.

'''Fu Hua:''' Otto’s obsession led him to plan this series of events…

'''Fu Hua:''' But he also left us an abundance of valuable experience when it comes to fighting the Honkai.

'''Fu Hua:''' No one’s life can be judged by a single metric.

'''Fu Hua:''' What he did, good or bad, has left deep marks on the world… and it’s our challenge to distinguish these marks and treat them differently.

The two said no more and quietly watched two birds fly far in the sky.

From this angle, Klostern looked just like what it was in their memory.

During her stay at Schicksal, Fu Hua usually found a quiet place to rest in her free time, watching the lights in the town turn on one by one.

Standing here once more but not alone, she was reminded of a poem from her homeland.

“On the old road to Xiangyang, withered orchids bid farewell to far-off travelers. If the heavens have feelings, they too will wither from grief.”

Theresa could tell from Fu Hua’s look that she was immersed in the reminiscence.

She knew it was a twilight hour better left to Fu Hua to indulge in alone.

'''Theresa:''' Such a nice view here… pity it’s almost time for me to meet with Nagamitsu.

'''Theresa:''' See you later then, Fu Hua?

'''Fu Hua:''' Yeah. See you later, Principal.

====<u>Gameplay 28-12 - Tomorrow’s the End</u>====
'''Nagamitsu:''' Hello! Everyone been busy lately? Lots of hard work, huh?

'''Nagamitsu:''' Now that everyone is here, let’s cut to the chase.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Come, this is the usage of the Cosmic Juggernaut on October 14th.

'''Nagamitsu:''' The raw data is around 1 billion gigabytes, stored into 2718 special hard drives. Everything about how Otto seized the Herrscher powers and linked to the Imaginary Tree.

'''Theresa:''' (…Are these boxes for real? That’s a lot of data.)

'''Nagamitsu:''' Unfortunately, during the Imaginary renormalisation, the Cosmic Juggernaut was compromised and data from that specific instant might not be accurate.

'''Amber:''' …I heard that the Cosmic Juggernaut sustained heavy damage.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Well, Otto did abuse it… but fortunately it’s not yet beyond repair.

'''Rita:''' That’s good news. I was worried we were summoned here to be informed that the Cosmic Juggernaut was totalled.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Haha, Divine Keys don’t break that easily.

'''Durandal:''' But Nagamitsu, you brought us all here just to move the data? The volume is indeed huge though…

'''Nagamitsu:''' Of course not. You’re not my mules.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Actually, there’s something I need to confess. Rita, you’ve noticed, right?

'''Durandal:''' …?

'''Rita:''' It’s no more than a wild guess. You’d better reveal it yourself, Master Nagamitsu.

'''Einstein:''' …

'''Nagamitsu:''' Indeed. It falls into your area of expertise, but you’re not in charge of it. Nor is Amber.

'''Theresa:''' …?

'''Nagamitsu:''' I confess…

'''Nagamitsu:''' Strictly speaking, I was never fired by Otto. On October 14th, the last task he assigned to me was…

'''Nagamitsu:''' “Inform Kiana of Imaginary renormalistion and help her cope with everything that comes next.”

'''Nagamitsu:''' Of course, setting everything aside, you all know how much I’m attracted to Otto’s plans.

'''Nagamitsu:''' So… to ensure his most elaborate plan worked, I did certain things to manage the outcome.

'''Nagamitsu:''' For example, reminding you of the possibility of resurrection, or helping the false Otto win everyone’s trust.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Or telling Durandal that Otto planned to destroy the world… Or helping you find a way to counter the power of Binding.

'''Theresa:''' Which is to say, you helped us just so we could learn about Imaginary renormalisation, which was part of Otto’s plan?

'''Nagamitsu:''' You can say that.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Of course, part of all I did didn’t help. On the contrary, I slowed you down.

'''Durandal:''' In other words, everything you did was to facilitate the final show in Otto’s life.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Yeah. Sorry, Bianka. When I was recording the tape, I knew Otto would send you to Imaginary Space.

'''Nagamitsu:''' I knew you were up to the challenge, but still, it betrayed our trust as friends.

'''Nagamitsu:''' I confess, whenever it comes to curiosity, I’m never a good person.

'''Nagamitsu:''' The technology to create another world… it’s fatally tempting to me.

'''Theresa:''' So, when Otto said he’d set the world back by five centuries… he really meant it.

'''Nagamitsu:''' …Yeah. But if it really came to that, World Serpent would benefit the most.

'''Nagamitsu:''' After all, Bianka proved one thing - that Stigmata can indeed transcend the world. With awakened Stigmata, they’re free from the Imaginary torrent just like Herrschers.

'''Durandal:''' (I knew it… I’m also one of the byproducts of Project STIGMA.)

'''Nagamitsu:''' Alright, that’s it. I’ll put everything into a report later.

'''Nagamitsu:''' That’s all I have to say. Anyway, during the crisis, I wasn’t always on your side.

'''Nagamitsu:''' So, Amber… as the discipline officer, you can punish me however you like.

'''Amber:''' …?

'''Nagamitsu:''' What? I don’t believe my confession and data gathering work are worth a get-out-of-jail-free card.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Don’t worry, I’ve been getting ready for life on the inside. As long as I can continue my research, everything is fine.

'''Amber:''' …

'''Amber:''' Nagamitsu, I know punishment can fulfill your need for atonement, but according to current Schicksal discipline procedures, you’re not guilty.

'''Nagamitsu:''' …Huh?

'''Amber:''' From the procedural angle, you told us the truth, only selectively. And as a result, you contributed to the solution.

'''Nagamitsu:''' But my example shouldn’t be followed, right? Otto would certainly do something about me if he was still in charge.

'''Amber:''' But his era has ended.

'''Nagamitsu:''' …

'''Theresa:''' Nagamitsu, if you truly wish to ease your guilt, stay at the St. 1504 Labs, and continue your research. The Cosmic Juggernaut needs you.

'''Nagamitsu:''' …Whoa. I wouldn’t dream of that.

'''Theresa:''' Are you not willing to accept?

'''Nagamitsu:''' No, not at all. It’s just… Overseer, your style couldn’t be any more different when compared to Otto’s.

'''Nagamitsu:''' But I did betray Bianka’s trust, so… at least allow me to give up my pay this year.

'''Nagamitsu:''' Otherwise, even a heartless person like me would be tortured inside.

'''Theresa:''' …I’ll allow it.

'''Durandal:''' Nagamitsu, you may have deceived us, but it led to good results. I don’t believe our friendship is damaged.

'''Nagamitsu:''' …Ah. 

'''Nagamitsu:''' Oh, I forgot you were such a blockhead. And I mean that as a compliment.

'''Rita:''' (Hehe, sounds like you only got to know Master Durandal today.)

'''Nagamitsu:''' (…Maybe.)

'''Durandal:''' …?

'''Theresa:''' Ahem, anyway, that concludes the meeting and you’re all dismissed. It’s weird for us to all stand here.

'''Amber:''' Ah, please wait, Master Theresa.

'''Theresa:''' Amber… is there anything else?

'''Amber:''' The townspeople heard that the Hyperion would leave tomorrow, and they made all this bread and apple strudel for you to eat on the way back.

'''Theresa:''' Huh? That’s too kind of them…

'''Amber:''' Just take them. They also gave the Schicksal Valkyries and staff members a few baskets as a token of gratitude.

Fresh bread and apple strudel filled the entire basket. On the handle was attached the orange balloon Theresa saw earlier.

'''Theresa:''' Thanks. I appreciate this.

====<u>Gameplay 28-13 - The Taste of a Memory</u>====
On the deck of the Hyperion, the regular maintenance before the return journey was coming to an end.

'''Bronya:''' …So did you see Mei afterwards?

'''Kiana:''' No.

'''Bronya:''' I see. Communicating through the Herrscher Core… it’s not something easy.

'''Kiana:''' Yeah.

'''Kiana:''' Ah, so modern tech is still the best. Aren’t you a genius hacker? Can you get me the number of World Serpent HQ?

'''Bronya:''' Are you serious?

'''Kiana:''' Hehe, just kidding.

Kiana put the maintenance toolkit away.

'''Kiana:''' I don’t even have to see Mei to know what she’s thinking.

'''Kiana:''' She’s always been helping us in her own way, whether it be when we were fighting the Herrscher of Domination or when we were fighting Otto.

'''Kiana:''' I must also become stronger.

'''Bronya:''' Then start with life skills. I’ll leave the cleaning up to you and go back to rest.

'''Kiana:''' Hey.

'''Theresa:''' Hi, Kiana and Bronya.

'''Kiana:''' Huh? Principal, you’re back?

'''Theresa:''' Yeah, just came back. Where are the others?

'''Bronya:''' Fu Hua came back a moment ago then went shopping for experiment supplies with Seele for Dr. Tesla.

'''Bronya:''' Rozaliya and Liliya went to Rita to ask for some souvenirs.

'''Theresa:''' I see. The townspeople sent us some bread and apple strudel. We’ll eat together once everyone is back.

'''Kiana:''' Whoa, smells so good. When are Seele and the others coming back?

'''Bronya:''' Should be about now.

'''Kiana:''' Let’s prepare some coffee and tea to go with the bread.

The billboards in Klostern were put under a golden coating by the afternoon sun. On the street, a few familiar figures waved their hands to the girls on the Hyperion.

It felt just like a laid-back afternoon.

'''Kiana:''' Hehe, we haven’t done this together for a long time.

'''Theresa:''' Yeah, it’s been ages since our last afternoon tea.

Night fell and the street lamps went on one by one.

Tourists left and the bustling town square finally quietened down. In the distance, the Hyperion was ready for the return journey tomorrow.

This small town with its centuries of history is about to usher in a new dawn.

…

“Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in.”

“I drink at it; but while I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is.”

“Its thin current slides away, but eternity remains. I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bottom is pebbly with stars.”

'''Rita:''' You seem to be reading all the time whenever you’re free, Master Durandal.

'''Durandal:''' Huh… really?

'''Rita:''' Ha, if you didn’t realise it yourself, it means there’s something on your mind.

'''Durandal:''' Something on my mind…

Durandal paused unnaturally for a second.

'''Durandal:''' …Oh, you mean the fact that Overseer Otto is no longer with us?

'''Rita:''' Yes, that’s one of the reasons.

'''Rita:''' He had a huge influence on every one of us. It’s like what he said…

'''Rita:''' “People are like rivers rushing to the sea. The closer they run to the sea, the muddier they get. But only the sea can absorb the muddy rivers without losing itself.”

'''Durandal:''' Like a river? Indeed, his river had been running for five centuries and it was full of impurities.

'''Durandal:''' But in the end, he rose above all of this and walked to the other side where there was no good or evil.

'''Durandal:''' I thought I knew him and how complicated he was… but now, I’m not so confident anymore.

'''Rita:''' …That also has something to do with your family, right?

'''Durandal:''' Yeah…

'''Durandal:''' …Huh?

'''Rita:''' You’re the daughter of Siegfried Kaslana and Cecilia Schariac. I knew it from the very beginning.

'''Durandal:''' The very beginning? Back when we met for the first time?

'''Rita:''' Yes, I had been working for a while in the special task force directly reporting to the Overseer.

'''Rita:''' So, if you wish to talk about this, I’m glad to hear it.

'''Durandal:''' I…

'''Durandal:''' Frankly, I had mixed feelings when I heard this secret within the Stigmata space.

'''Durandal:''' Not that I found it hard to believe. Not that it happened without any hint that I was confused…

'''Durandal:''' Just that some faces came to mind… Siegfried, Kiana, and Theresa who had been taking care of Kiana.

'''Durandal:''' For them, it remained a secret for too long… that it became sensitive and complicated. It might hurt them if revealed improperly.

'''Durandal:''' So… I decided to keep this a secret, until everyone is gathered together and the right time comes.

'''Rita:''' You’re still the caring and thoughtful person I know.

'''Rita:''' I know Master Durandal’s concerns… and I wish for Master Durandal to understand…

'''Rita:''' That I’ll always stay by your side and share all the secrets.

'''Durandal:''' Ah… thank you, Rita.

'''Durandal:''' With you around supporting me… I feel extremely lucky.

'''Durandal:''' Really, thank you, Rita.

'''Rita:''' …It’s my honor and pleasure, Master Durandal.

Deeply touched, Durandal closed her eyes for a moment.

'''Durandal:''' …

'''Durandal:''' Within Stigmata space, I saw what Siegfried once did… and respect for him grew naturally within me.

'''Durandal:''' He carried too much on his shoulders and left too many regrets…

'''Durandal:''' But he never gave up hope and firmly believed that he’d return to his family. He stayed strong and fought hard for the future he envisioned.

'''Durandal:''' In honor of his conviction, I promise that one day, together with Kiana, I’ll get our father out from the hell he’s in.

'''Durandal:''' When that happens, I wish you’d still be by my side fighting together.

'''Rita:''' Of course, Master Durandal. You can always count on me.

…

The moon rose and the night matured.

In the book Durandal read again recently, the author lived a solitary and self-sustained life by the lake, in a cabin built by himself.

The author said, “wherever I sat, there I might live, and the landscape radiated from me accordingly.”

“I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to face only the essential facts of life…”

“…And see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.”

After the battle, Durandal reformed the Valkyrie institutions with Theresa and Amber, and formulated a future plan with members of the Immortal Blades.

Afterwards, she stayed at Rita’s house for a few days, preparing for their journey to Vesuvius.

During her short stay with Rita’s family, she was afforded the first glimpse into the arts of flowers and tea, and the first taste of iconic dishes from Rita’s homeland.

This casual and trivial family life was an eye-opening fresh experience to her.

“Of course, Master Durandal. You can always count on me.”

…Haha, yeah.

…Maybe the reason to go to battle was that simple after all.

Durandal smiled. She asked herself, since when did she become so sensitive and sentimental?

But at least for now, she knew very clearly that no matter what life had in store for her, she wouldn’t be facing it alone.

Rita, the Abyss Flower, the Immortal Blades, and Schicksal reborn…

…No, not just what and who kept her company right now.

Siegfried, Shigure, Dr. Schrodinger, and friends from the bubble universe who had fought by her side…

And the Hyperion crew who once held a different belief but eventually joined her path and battle…

All of them would, in one way or another, share her life’s journey someday.

It was just like what she said before…

“No matter how ridiculous people think it is, we’re still gonna make it come true!”

Earlier, somewhere in Imaginary Space.

'''Mei:''' …

A pure white, vacant space.

Where time was flowing much slower.

'''Mei:''' …

'''Mei:''' I knew I’d find you here.

…

'''Mei:''' Kiana is back in reality, and I’ve done what I can do.

'''Mei:''' So let’s talk about you.

'''Mei:''' Otto wasn’t afraid of you, and neither am I.

…

…

'''Mei:''' …I have many questions for you.

===Interstice===

===Utmost Fog===

====<u>Special Trip</u>====
What Rita experienced after sending Bronya off:

'''Rita:''' Genius… the mutual saturation of the Sea of Quanta and the Imaginary Tree…

'''Rita:''' Dr. Schrodinger, are we in a position to do something that can help Master Durandal?

'''Schrodinger:''' …Looks like your ability to search stable spaces has become stronger, Rita.

'''Schrodinger:''' You knew that the Genius could reach me around this part and you spoke to me on purpose, right?

'''Rita:''' Ha, it’s just my usual luck holding on.

'''Rita:''' That aside, Dr. Schrodinger, how is Master Durandal doing from your observation?

'''Schrodinger:''' She’s still alive.

'''Rita:''' I know.

'''Schrodinger:''' Then… I’ve no more knowledge than you.

'''Schrodinger:''' As we suspected, Otto rigged her Genius.

'''Schrodinger:''' We saw it coming and planted the space navigation program in your old Genius beforehand, right?

'''Rita:''' Yes… but I’m still worried Master Durandal might run into some unexpected difficulties.

'''Schrodinger:''' So you’re asking me while you’re in the Sea of Quanta, if there’s a way for you to confirm her current situation in Imaginary Space.

'''Rita:''' It’s part of my duty as a maid.

'''Schrodinger:''' …Alright. Bad news first.

'''Schrodinger:''' From experience, it’s impossible for you to get across the spatial barrier and reach Bianka in real-time.

'''Schrodinger:''' But… there’s always an exception.

'''Schrodinger:''' There are always rare saturation conditions that allow you to reach Imaginary Space from the Sea of Quanta.

'''Schrodinger:''' But to identify such space coordinates might take more time than waiting for Bianka’s return.

'''Schrodinger:''' If this is still fine by you… I can indeed lead you to some special places.

'''Rita:''' Special Quantum spaces?

'''Schrodinger:''' …That’s a very general description.

'''Schrodinger:''' But these places are indeed fragments of fragments and illusions of illusions.

'''Schrodinger:''' So, no matter what your eyes see later, don’t be fooled by appearances.

'''Schrodinger:''' After all, the interstices I’ll bring you to are all bubble universe fragments that are nearly fully absorbed by the Imaginary Tree.

'''Rita:''' I see… we’re taking the moment of their disintegration to get across the barrier?

'''Schrodinger:''' Yes, and that requires a fair bit of luck.

'''Schrodinger:''' We’ll get started once you’re ready. There are some details I need to fill you in on the way.

'''[CHOICE] =''' Set out for the interstices

'''Genius:''' …

--

====<u>Up Creek</u>====
An everlasting thick mist was spreading out in bubble universe fragments.

In the mist, huge and bizarre shadows twisting slowly could be vaguely made out.

'''Genius:''' …

The Genius started to flash. Following its direction, a creek emerged beneath Rita’s feet…

'''[CHOICE] =''' Touch the stream

The moment her finger came in contact with the stream, whispers sounded.

The chilling water stung the nerves and the soft murmurs faded away.

'''[CHOICE] =''' Look into the mist

An everlasting thick mist was spreading out in bubble universe fragments.

The shadows cloaked in the mist were moving and twisting slowly closer.

'''[CHOICE] =''' Search for chips

Some unknown chips were left at the corner. Maybe some useful info can be extracted.

'''Genius:''' …

--

====<u>Crooked</u>====
All paths converged into one here.

On the slanting road sign there seemed to be some blurred words.

Not far away, the control room was barely visible in the mist. Maybe some chips could be found on the old machines to upgrade the Genius.

'''[CHOICE] =''' Check the road sign on the left

Strange and eerie words could be seen on the road sign, foreshadowing the coming of danger.

'''Genius:''' …

'''[CHOICE] =''' Check the road sign on the right

The words on the road sign were too blurred to make out.

The mist grew thin and all was quiet. At the end of the road, the lurking shadow was about to be revealed.

'''[CHOICE] =''' Check the platform in the mist

The control room was long overrun by weeds. After removing the thick dust, some intact chips were found.

'''Genius:''' …

--

====<u>Communication</u>====
After getting to a vantage point, Rita started the communication experiment according to Dr. Schrodinger’s instructions.

'''Rita:''' The reception here is not strong enough.

'''Schrodinger:''' As expected.

'''Schrodinger:''' Record the coordinates with the strongest reception and move to the next space. Nothing can be found here.

'''Rita:''' Dr. Schrodinger.

'''Schrodinger:''' What’s wrong?

'''Rita:''' …Maybe instead of a reception problem, it’s that Master Durandal is giving out too weak a signal?

'''Schrodinger:''' Very likely. But that’s beyond our power.

'''Schrodinger:''' As I told you at the beginning, it’s a very long shot.

'''Schrodinger:''' Possibilities like this are part of the reason why.

'''Rita:''' …Understood. Let’s keep on searching other spaces.

'''Schrodinger:''' I like your persistence. Just take this as another voyage of ours.

'''Schrodinger:''' Let’s go.

===Bedlam Zone===

====<u>Gathering</u>====
It was a land of chaos. Neither time nor direction could be perceived here.

It was like a small boat drifting onto the dark sea. Only the Genius was working to point the way as usual.

'''Genius:''' …

These clues are far from enough. Now what needs to be done is…

'''[CHOICE] =''' Collect intel

'''Genius:''' …

The prompt sounded and the Genius sent over collected info.

'''[CHOICE] =''' Search for signals

'''Genius:''' …

'''[CHOICE] =''' Check chips

'''Genius:''' …

'''Rita:''' Huh? Seems like I was sent to a strange space…

--

====<u>Missing Intel</u>====
In the Genius scanning report, apart from “coordinates with the strongest reception” and “detected chips”, “special monsters” were brought up for the first time.

…Right now, there seems to be something approaching from behind with low rustling.

Currently, what’s disturbing you is…

'''[CHOICE] =''' Listen carefully

The voices from the surroundings rose and fell repeating the same words over and over again.

“Don’t look back… Don’t look back… Don’t look back…”

'''[CHOICE] =''' Special monsters

'''Genius:''' …

'''[CHOICE] =''' “Chips detected.”

'''Genius:''' …

--

====<u>Dark Drift</u>====
The temperature was dropping and pressure came from every direction.

Icy crystals spread out on the ground forming floral patterns, and in the shadow not far off, the flames were flickering.

What needs to be done now is…

'''[CHOICE] =''' Check the icy crystals

The air near the ground was chilled and dove under the frost point to form a blanket of frost.

'''[CHOICE] =''' Check the flames

What needs to be done now is…

'''[CHOICE] =''' Upgrade Genius

--

====<u>Overstay</u>====
'''Rita:''' No signal received. Looks like the conditions here are even worse.

'''Schrodinger:''' We’ve been searching for a long time.

'''Schrodinger:''' If you’re tired, how about returning to the last anchor point?

'''Schrodinger:''' Sometimes waiting is the smartest strategy.

'''Rita:''' Dr. Schrodinger, I believe you’ve heard this before…

'''Rita:''' But the maid’s training is to challenge her limits again and again.

'''Schrodinger:''' …Never heard of it.

'''Rita:''' Oh, I must add, it only applies to the maid of the Immortal Blades.

'''Schrodinger:''' Alright, I see it now. You’re no different from Bianka, trying to muscle your way out.

'''Rita:''' Thanks for the compliment. It’s an honor to be compared to Master Durandal.

'''Schrodinger:''' …Fine. Anyway, maybe you can still carry on seeing you’re in the mood to tell jokes.

'''Schrodinger:''' Alright, let’s go and explore the next dangerous area.

'''Rita:''' Sure.

===Shattered Illusion===

====<u>Free Fall</u>====
As if plunging into the deep sea.

The world was turned upside down and the view was blurred in the fall.

…

Finally, consciousness came back in the shattered and fragmented mirage.

Now the focus should be to…

'''[CHOICE] =''' Check this area

Now the focus should be to…

'''[CHOICE] =''' Collect battle intel

'''Genius:''' …

'''[CHOICE] =''' Search for chips

'''Genius:''' …

--

====<u>Miscommunication</u>====
Within sight there was nothing but lifeless ruins.

The crack on the ground expanded far and wide into the horizon. There seemed to be something moving about in the crack.

'''[CHOICE] =''' Check the crack

Pitch dark.

In the darkness, a giant eye rolled and kept staring at the broken world.

'''[CHOICE] =''' Collect battle intel

'''Genius:''' …

'''[CHOICE] =''' Check the ruins

Light poured down from the top of the ruins. The unknown machines were all dusted, but there were some usable chips left.

'''Genius:''' …

--

====<u>Empty</u>====
Wild vines claimed the stairs, and the deserted resource depot was covered by thick dust. A low roar sounded from ahead, shaking the entire space.

No doubt a nasty fight was waiting ahead.

Now, what requires attention is…

'''[CHOICE] =''' The huge roar

'''Genius:''' …

'''[CHOICE] =''' Conduct communication experiment

Now, what requires attention is…

'''[CHOICE] =''' Search the resource depot

In an almost unnoticeable corner, there were some chips that might be useful.

'''Genius:''' …

--

====<u>Seed of Sumeru</u>====
'''Rita:''' This time, the signal is on and off, not very strong and steady.

'''Schrodinger:''' After all, this is the Sea of Quanta, and it’s Imaginary Space on the other side.

'''Schrodinger:''' But at least we know that Bianka’s Genius is still working, and that’s a relief for you, right?

'''Rita:''' …

Rita didn’t answer. After the long journey, a possible solution began to take shape in her mind.

'''Rita:''' Dr. Schrodinger, in your previous calculations, did you factor in the Seed of Sumeru?

'''Schrodinger:''' You mean the bubble universe stabilizer transferred into your body? You think it can help us search?

'''Rita:''' Just a vague feeling. After all, this is not my area of expertise.

'''Rita:''' From what I’m personally feeling, when we leap across spaces, the energy within the Seed of Sumeru seems to fluctuate as well.

'''Rita:''' The fluctuations… reminded me of when Master Durandal was entering and exiting the Seed of Sumeru.

'''Rita:''' This got me thinking. As the observation room for the Cosmic Juggernaut, the Seed of Sumeru had been operating for thousands of years.

'''Rita:''' Maybe it’s able to give us a way to amplify signals?

'''Schrodinger:''' That said… the only one left to operate the Seed of Sumeru is you.

'''Schrodinger:''' If you can’t fully understand the way it works, I can’t help either.

'''Rita:''' …Alright, let me try first.

Rita began to follow what Durandal did before and sent her consciousness into the Seed of Sumeru.

Unlike the last time, without the guidance of its master, entangled information rushed into her mind all at once.

Just like a first-time swimmer, she couldn’t think or control anything about her…

But the long years of Valkyrie training pulled herself back together to face the situation calmly.

Very soon, she learned how to tell the flowing path of every piece of intel.

The noises of the Sea of Quanta, the rhythm of bubble universes spinning, the light curtain born in reality…

She began to perceive them all and extract useful information.

'''Rita:''' …!

'''Schrodinger:''' …How is it going? Your breathing seems disturbed. Are you okay?

'''Rita:''' I’m fine… It’s just like swimming for the first time and I choked myself once or twice.

Rita told Schrodinger what she observed through the Seed of Sumeru.

'''Schrodinger:''' Tsk. Damn Otto. He has more cards up his sleeve.

'''Schrodinger:''' If Bianka can’t make it back in time…

'''Rita:''' …Wait, Dr. Schrodinger, now! Try to capture the signals around me using the Genius!

'''Schrodinger:''' Huh? This is…

Just when they were talking about the Seed of Sumeru, the energy level in it began to surge drastically.

On the other side of the Genius, Schrodinger clearly felt that the signal from Durandal just spiked.

The two seized the moment and established a communication channel right away.

They heard the voice they had been longing to hear.

'''???:''' This is Durandal. Please speak.

Of course, she doesn’t need us to worry about her.

Rita thought so and felt great relief.

'''Rita:''' Master Durandal!
