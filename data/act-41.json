…

“They are like two people walking abreast. One can see the path ahead, while the other is blind,”

“The fact that the blind is unaware of their blindness can only relieve themself.”

Thus, for the person that can see the path ahead, what is their relief?

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' Did I… fall asleep?

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' Ah, dropped the brush.

'''Griseo:''' Ngh!

'''Griseo:''' Head, dizzy…

'''Griseo:''' And Mr. Knight isn’t here either.

'''Griseo:''' The grass here is as soft as clouds. It’s comfortable to step on it.

'''Griseo:''' If I can draw on grass like this forever…

'''Griseo:''' Would I feel a great happiness?

<tabber>
|-|An unfinished painting.=
'''Griseo:''' At this rate, the concept art won’t be finished until tomorrow.

'''Griseo:''' But today’s the day Nuwa and I agreed on.
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
</tabber>

<tabber>
|-|A flowing, lively painting.=
<br>'''Griseo:''' When was this painting finished?
</tabber>

'''Griseo:''' It’s Mr. Knight!

'''Knight:''' Good morning, Griseo.

'''Griseo:''' Good morning, Mr. Knight.

'''Knight:''' Griseo, you don’t look too well. Is there something bothering you?

'''Griseo:''' I felt a little dizzy earlier, but I’m much better now.

'''Knight:''' Perhaps some food will help?

Speaking, the towering knight slightly leaned forward and extended his hand towards the girl. To her surprise, his giant hand, gleaming coldly, was holding a delicate wooden food box.

'''Griseo:''' Huh? Mr. Knight, you left the studio just to bring me breakfast?

'''Knight:''' Well… you did say yesterday that you must finish painting before sleeping.

'''Knight:''' And once you’re engrossed in something, you ignore everything around you…

'''Knight:''' I’m sure you were so engrossed in painting that you didn’t even realise you fell asleep.

'''Griseo:''' My apologies, Mr. Knight. I will keep that in mind.

Griseo, with an apologetic nod, swiftly finished the breakfast Nuwa had prepared.

The satisfying meal revived the exhausted girl, and thus jogged her memory about some important matters.

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight, has Nuwa returned?

'''Knight:''' Yes, she’s currently tending to the clay ore she brought back.

'''Griseo:''' D-Did she ask about my progress?

'''Knight:''' No. It never crossed her mind that you might not have finished the painting.

'''Griseo:''' …!

'''Knight:''' Looks like you really haven’t finished it.

'''Griseo:''' I… I’ll finish it tomorrow, for sure!

'''Knight:''' For that, are you planning to burn the midnight oil in the studio?

'''Griseo:''' Well…

'''Knight:''' Griseo, remember, Nuwa isn’t an editor at a publishing house, and you’re not a comic artist with deadlines. Right now, you’re both normal people living your lives here.

'''Griseo:''' Normal people…

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight, though I see your point, the latter part… should only apply to myself.

'''Knight:''' Perhaps.

'''Knight:''' You’re not the implementer of Project EMBER or Project VALUKA. As for the backup option, Project ARK, it didn’t proceed after the Ark’s return either.

'''Knight:''' The Griseo of today has many tomorrows ahead, with no one to rush the present and no need to fret about the future.

'''Knight:''' So… why the rush to say “tomorrow, for sure”?

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' I…

As she pondered, a familiar color filled a corner of her vision.

'''Griseo:''' Eh… why are my studies here?

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' Don’t worry. Let us recover them one by one.

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' Recovery complete.

'''Griseo:''' Thank you, Mr. Knight.

'''Knight:''' We don’t have to be this polite with each other.

'''Griseo:''' Regardless, it’s a relief to have you helping out, Mr. Knight. If those creatures had escaped outside, it would have really spelled trouble.

'''Griseo:''' They were stashed at the bottom of the storage box. I might’ve accidentally mixed them in when sorting out the drawings to give to Nuwa last night.

'''Knight:''' Don’t worry, even if they made it further outside, someone will take care of them.

'''Griseo:''' You mean Nuwa and Fuxi?

'''Griseo:''' They’re not MANTISes. Even if they’re just studies, they’d be quite difficult for them.

'''Knight:''' …

'''Knight:''' You haven’t forgotten what day it is today, have you?

'''Griseo:''' Wait… Mr. Knight, was there anything else that I promised Nuwa?

'''Knight:''' …Never mind, you’ve been occupied with painting lately. It’s understandable if you forgot.

'''Knight:''' Yet, if Nuwa asks about it later, make sure not to look surprised, okay?

'''Griseo:''' Hmm…?

…

…

…

The scenery here is amazing, I could look at it forever.

'''Knight:''' Yeah.

'''Griseo:''' The mottled trees, clear waters, and a spectrum of green…

'''Griseo:''' Ah, a sketch from this angle is good too, worthy of an art.

'''???:''' Does little Griseo need some paper?

'''Griseo:''' Of course, thank you…

…

…

'''Griseo:''' N-Nuwa… and Fuxi, hello there!

'''Nuwa:''' Oh Griseo, am I really that intimidating to you?

'''Griseo:''' Absolutely not! I’m just… um…

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' Nuwa, I’m really sorry. I’m still one drawing short of the promise I made to you.

'''Nuwa:''' Then, could you show me the completed ones first?

'''Griseo:''' I’m afraid I can’t…

'''Griseo:''' Because… I want the day when I reveal all of them to you to be a big surprise!

'''Nuwa:''' Don’t worry about that. You showing them to me now is enough of a surprise.

'''Griseo:''' But… um…

'''Nuwa:''' My dear Griseo, as prodigiously talented as I am, without your concept artwork to build upon, I can only stare at my precious clay until dawn. Surely you can’t bear to watch such a sorry sight!

'''Fuxi:''' You just want to indulge your curiosity.

'''Nuwa:''' So what if I do?

'''Nuwa:''' Our little Griseo is here in Shenzhou for a rare visit, and we don’t know when she’ll leave. So of course we must take the opportunity to create something that will prove our friendship!

'''Fuxi:''' If the painting you asked Griseo to create can faithfully portray everyone and serve as a photograph of our memories, then I won’t have anything to say.

'''Fuxi:''' But twisting our images with your headcanons, and then writing myths in a form that’s easily accepted by the people of this era…

'''Fuxi:''' Aren’t you feeling at least a bit ashamed of it?

'''Nuwa:''' Not at all. In fact, I’m quite proud of it!

'''Nuwa:''' We’ve all worked so hard. Naturally, we deserve to be immortalised in a myth!

'''Nuwa:''' Anyway, that’s a story for another time. Now, if little Griseo could show me the concept artwork right now, it would certainly make my myth writing even smoo…

'''Nuwa:''' Ow! Fuxi, why did you pinch my face?

'''Fuxi:''' Just take it down a notch, will you? You wouldn’t let others see the details of your sculpture before it’s properly molded, would you?

'''Nuwa:''' Why, of course I would. Who knows, maybe I could even hear some valuable suggestions.

'''Fuxi:''' …

'''Fuxi:''' Griseo, don’t listen to Nuwa’s nonsense. Just paint at your own pace.

'''Fuxi:''' Of course, in this process, don’t easily give away your artwork to other people. Mr. Knight, I hope you can continue to remind Griseo of this.

'''Knight:''' Certainly, you have my word.

'''Nuwa:''' Why do I sense that there’s more to your words?

'''Fuxi:''' I’m speaking from experience. You see, when art floods the market, it not only disrupts the market, but also significantly devalues itself.

'''Griseo:''' The last thing I want is for Griseo’s art to not sell in the future.

'''Griseo:''' Um…

'''Fuxi:''' Anyway, let’s wrap up the small talk. Today is the Pioneers’ Gathering, an annual event that deserves our full attention.

'''Nuwa:''' That’s right, let’s go!

'''Nuwa:''' Little Griseo, why do you seem surprised?

'''Griseo:''' I just didn’t expect everyone to come so soon.

'''Fuxi:''' They’re Kevin and Su, after all.

'''Fuxi:''' As for Hua, she’s active in Shenzhou, so it’s fairly convenient for her to come.

'''Su:''' Long time no see, Griseo.

'''Griseo:''' Uncle Su, Uncle Kevin, long time no see.

'''Kevin:''' You seem to have grown a bit taller this year.

'''Knight:''' Maybe it’s because in the year since the Ark’s return, Griseo and I have traveled to various places together.

'''Griseo:''' Yeah, Granny Mobius used to tell me, “Even though I dislike it, exercise does promote bone growth”.

'''Nuwa:''' Oh, this applies to Kevin as well. I remember Dr. MEI mentioning that when Kevin was still in school, he was the best at sports.

'''Su:''' But in reality, he didn’t really care whether sports would help him grow taller or not.

'''Kevin:''' …Su.

'''Griseo:''' Huh?

'''Kevin:''' …

'''Kevin:''' Like most guys, I just enjoy the feeling of winning.

'''Kevin:''' And… the attention that winners get.

'''Griseo:''' I see.

'''Nuwa:''' Too bad there’s no basketball here. Otherwise, Kevin would’ve been able to show off.

'''Kevin:''' Heh.

'''Kevin:''' Even though there’s no basketball, I’ve brought some other “ball” with me this time.

It was rare for Kevin to crack a joke, and everyone in the room smiled, simply because it was him who had said it.

But he didn’t mind. He simply placed a translucent crystal ball on the stone table and wound up the spring on its base.

…

Before long, as the music began to play, the miniature city within the crystal ball came to life, starting a vibrant “new day” in harmony.

'''Kevin:''' This is something we stumbled upon in the Sanctuary. A souvenir from Eden’s concert.

'''Kevin:''' And I want to…

'''Kevin:''' Give it to Griseo.

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' Uncle Kevin, can I really accept it?

'''Kevin:''' Of course. It suits you better than it does me now.

The deep blue in front of the girl suddenly stirred.

'''Kevin:''' Before the old era came to a close, it, or its kind, accompanied me through many sleepless nights.

'''Kevin:''' Back then, simply by gazing at it, I could transport myself by music into this small realm of solace and find a moment of peace there.

'''Kevin:''' …But one day, I suddenly lost this ability.

'''Kevin:''' The music, instead of soothing my spirit, became the cause of my insomnia.

'''Kevin:''' I knew it wasn’t the music’s fault. It was mine instead.

The man gently caressed the crystal ball, as if wiping away the minute dust that clung to it.

Or perhaps, he was bidding a final farewell to those nights when it had been his companion.

'''Kevin:''' …

'''Kevin:''' Griseo, you have a pure heart.

'''Kevin:''' This purity will grant you a versatile perspective, enabling you to see views in the music and the miniature city that I didn’t, and never will.

'''Kevin:''' That led me to believe that you are the perfect person to have this crystal ball.

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' But…

'''Su:''' Griseo, this is something Kevin and I had planned for a long time.

'''Su:''' It’s just that the time when you just returned to Earth… wasn’t the right time to gift it.

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Nuwa:''' I don’t get it.

'''Nuwa:''' Wouldn’t it be even more meaningful to wait for Griseo’s birthday in six months?

'''Su:''' That’s a good point.

'''Su:''' But… do you think Griseo will stay here forever?

'''Nuwa:''' Little Griseo loves us so much, of course she wouldn’t want to leave!

'''Griseo:''' Yeah…

'''Nuwa:''' By the way, where did Hua go? Wasn’t she just here, having tea with you all a moment ago?

'''Su:''' Yes. But she left in a hurry halfway, saying she wanted to check on the vegetable garden.

'''Nuwa:''' With me taking care of it, what could possibly go wrong with the vegetable garden?

'''Fuxi:''' I’m afraid that’s precisely why Hua’s worried.

'''Nuwa:''' Fuxi, you haven’t lifted a bucket of water, let alone visited the garden once, and you have the audacity to blame me? Shame on you!

'''Fuxi:''' …

'''Fuxi:''' Griseo, if you and Mr. Knight don’t mind the trouble…

'''Griseo:''' Sure. I’ll go and bring Hua back right away.

'''Nuwa:''' Su, regarding the favor I asked of you last year, has there been any progress?

'''Su:''' …I’m afraid the ending of the comic you wanted to see, along with the world that it was in, had sunk into the “sea” and scattered like bubbles.

'''Nuwa:''' Never mind, I should’ve realised that that world wasn’t fundamentally different from our previous civilisation.

'''Nuwa:''' We’re just a bit luckier since we still have the chance to continue the story.

'''Su:''' Yes.

'''Nuwa:''' So, have you discovered any interesting worlds afterward?

'''Nuwa:''' I mean… the kind with lots of anime, comics, games, movies, and novels.

'''Su:''' Yeah, there’re a few.

'''Nuwa:''' That’s wonderful! Since Hua hasn’t come back yet, why don’t you let me take a look? I’m sure these worlds will provide plenty of inspiration for my myths!

'''Kevin:''' …

'''Fuxi:''' …

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight, I'm ready.

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' Then let’s set out.

--

====<u>Gameplay 41-2 - Sowing</u>====
'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight, why didn’t you talk at all?

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' I… I was only thinking about things.

'''Griseo:''' Hmm?

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' Pay it no mind. More importantly, we’re going to call Hua back now, right?

'''Griseo:''' Yeah.

'''Griseo:''' Ah, I found Hua.

'''Hua:''' Oh, it’s Griseo and Mr. Knight.

'''Hua:''' How have you all been adjusting to life in Shenzhou?

'''Griseo:''' Pretty good, thanks to the help of Nuwa and Fuxi.

'''Knight:''' Yeah, everything has been going smoothly except for the fact that I’m still not very skilled with chopsticks.

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight…

'''Hua:''' Haha.

'''Griseo:''' …Hua, what are you doing right now? It looks like you’re planting seeds.

'''Hua:''' Yes, it’s mid-spring, the perfect time for planting.

'''Hua:''' The other piece of land that I asked Nuwa to take care of will be ready for harvest soon.

'''Griseo:''' Erm…

'''Hua:''' Judging by your response, Nuwa knows she wasn’t tending to the garden properly and sent you, right?

'''Hua:''' However, over the past month or so, the weather has been light rain followed by a few days of sun, and the aster I assigned her to grow is already a low-maintenance wild vegetable.

'''Hua:''' Speaking of which, Griseo, would you like to give planting a try?

'''Griseo:''' Huh?

'''Griseo:''' …Yeah, I’d love to!

'''Hua:''' Take three seeds in your hand like this, and then sprinkle them into the small holes made with sticks.

'''Hua:''' Afterward, gently press your foot down to flatten the soil. This will improve seed-soil contact without reducing air permeability.

'''Griseo:''' Hua, you know so much about this.

'''Hua:''' Actually, this is the most primitive method of sowing. There are many complex techniques in farming that I haven’t mastered yet.

'''Griseo:''' You’re already very amazing! I recall that you designed and built this house on the hill yourself, right?

'''Hua:''' Yes, but behind the success you see, there were many failures. It’s just an example of how practice makes perfect.

'''Griseo:''' …?

'''Hua:''' You probably don’t know this, but before joining the MOTHs, I lived with my father, who ran a martial arts school. At that time, I immersed myself in various martial arts.

'''Hua:''' Later, my father fell ill and was hospitalised, which shifted my life toward taking care of my family.

'''Hua:''' During that time, I picked up some nursing skills and even worked odd jobs to contribute to the household, including helping on construction sites and farmlands.

'''Hua:''' I still remember that my father always told me to become someone promising. He believed that whether it was in academics, business, politics, or the military, having skills and resources would open doors to success.

'''Hua:''' I didn’t quite understand his words back then… did inheriting our family’s martial arts school not hold any promise?

'''Griseo:''' …My Mum and Dad never talked to me about these things.

'''Griseo:''' They just let me paint freely and do whatever I wanted.

'''Griseo:''' So, could it be that your Dad had unrealistic expectations for you?

Hua shook her head gently.

'''Hua:''' …My father wasn’t highly educated and had suffered from poverty, so he didn’t want me to go through the same hardships.

'''Hua:''' Ato and Blanca understood the value of freedom in the end times, which is why they chose to give you the utmost freedom.

'''Hua:''' And this is also what we sowers are to the seeds.

'''Hua:''' Even in the face of an uncertain future… we must hold ourselves accountable for every seed we sow.

'''Griseo:''' I see. Is this the true meaning of Project EMBER?

'''Hua:''' Ah… No…

'''???:''' I’m sorry, but I have to interrupt your conversation for today’s lunch.

'''Hua:''' Fuxi? What happened?

'''Fuxi:''' Well, it’s not a big deal, really.

'''Fuxi:''' In simple terms, my silly little sister got obsessed with comics and wouldn’t come out of the world observed by the 2nd Divine Key.

'''Fuxi:''' Although Su can forcibly terminate the observation, doing so would also have irreversible effects on the psyche of an ordinary person like her.

'''Fuxi:''' So, we need someone to go in and bring her out.

'''Fuxi:''' Considering that she’s currently in need of Griseo’s help, we’d appreciate it if Griseo could do it.

'''Griseo:''' Okay… Wait, what?

The group quickly gathered around Su.

'''Su:''' I’m sorry, Fuxi. Nuwa… she ignored all my warnings.

'''Fuxi:''' It’s alright, that’s just how she is. She’s probably reading a plot point right now.

'''Fuxi:''' Anyway, we don’t need to stand here and wait.

'''Fuxi:''' Mr. Knight, you can arrange your schedule as you see fit. As for Hua, you’re in charge of today’s lunch, while Kevin and I will help you.

With that, Fuxi took Hua by one hand and Kevin by the other, and hurried toward the kitchen.

Meanwhile, Griseo, guided by Su, closed her eyes…

The wait wasn’t long, only a few seconds, and the girl soon sensed an atmosphere that didn’t belong to the forest.

…

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' Is this the world where Nuwa is?

'''Su:''' Yes. Just as she expected, this is a world whose entertainment industry is highly developed.

'''Su:''' The residents living here are passionate about all activities that satisfy their spiritual needs.

'''Su:''' In the context of bubble universes, their imagination is astounding, and their creativity often takes the form of novels, comics, and movies. Some of the ideas they convey could widely inspire others.

'''Griseo:''' There’s no way Nuwa could resist the allure of this world…

'''Griseo:''' Uncle Su, have you found out where she is?

'''Su:''' Yes. I will now guide you to the bookstore where she is.

'''Su:''' However, during this process, it’s essential not to engage with the residents here in any way. Acts such as communication or offering assistance would disrupt the equilibrium of the mental projection, leading to the forced termination of the observation.

'''Su:''' After all, you are not physical in this world.

'''Griseo:''' Yes, I understand.

'''Griseo:''' (They seem to be talking about movies.)

'''Griseo:''' (A long time ago…)

'''Griseo:''' (Little Elysia filmed a movie with everyone.)

'''Griseo:''' (This man sounds happy, but his color is a grim gray.)

'''Griseo:''' (Gray… A color I’m familiar with.)

'''Griseo:''' (Although Uncle Su isn’t rushing me, I better go get Nuwa first.)

As Su mentioned, at the end of the alley, there was a uniquely decorated bookstore.

However, just as Griseo was about to follow the crowd into it, Su stopped her.

'''Su:''' Griseo, there’s a change in plans.

'''Su:''' It seems Nuwa has seized the chance of my projecting your psyche here to leave.

'''Griseo:''' Wow, Nuwa is that sharp?

'''Su:''' She knew my energy was limited. It’s impossible for me to closely monitor her activity while remotely guiding another person.

'''Su:''' …In truth, she’s been playing this cat-and-mouse game since the first Pioneers’ Gathering.

'''Griseo:''' No wonder Fuxi wasn’t worried at all. And you seem to be enjoying it as well.

'''Su:''' …

'''Su:''' Indeed. After playing this many times, I could predict where Nuwa might go to read comics next. We just need to verify the possibilities one by one.

'''Su:''' Of course, to save time, once you confirm the specific destination, I’ll teleport you there directly.

<tabber>
|-|[CHOICE] - Investigate the Cat Café.=
…

'''Griseo:''' Uncle Su, let’s go take a look at the Cat Café.

'''Griseo:''' A quiet and cozy atmosphere often sparks inspiration. She might go there because of this.

'''Su:''' Of course.

After searching inside the Cat Café, Griseo quickly concluded that Nuwa hadn’t been there.

However, another group of curious beings noticed this observer from another world.

'''Cat:''' Meow?

The girl carefully shifted her steps, trying to leave the circle of cats as gently as possible.

Yet, her decision to leave without playing with the cats didn’t sit well with the cats.

'''Cat:''' Meow…

'''Griseo:''' Sorry. I promise, next time… I’ll pet all of you.

'''Su:''' Cats have unpredictable personalities and heightened senses compared to humans. This response is difficult to avoid.

'''Su:''' So, where are we heading next?

'''Su:''' Of course, to save time, once you confirm the specific destination, I’ll teleport you there directly.
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
|-|[CHOICE] - Investigate the restaurant.=
…

'''Griseo:''' Although it’s very unlikely, taking Nuwa’s personality into account…

'''Griseo:''' Let’s investigate the restaurant.

With that thought in mind, the girl entered a restaurant that smelled enticing.

But this time, she still couldn’t find Nuwa, and made herself hungry in the process.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Growl*

'''Griseo:''' (Why? I can feel hunger even as a projected psyche…)

'''Su:''' Seems we need to pick up the pace if we want to have lunch.

'''Su:''' Of course, to save time, once you confirm the specific destination, I’ll teleport you there directly.
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
|-|[CHOICE] - Investigate the arcade.=
…

'''Griseo:''' I don’t know why, but I have a feeling that this is the place Nuwa is most likely to be.

'''Su:''' In the last cat-and-mouse game, Fuxi also said something similar.

'''Su:''' The result, on the other hand…

'''Su:''' A crowded arcade is a good place to hide, but definitely not suitable for reading.

'''Griseo:''' You’re right… I should’ve thought it through.

'''Su:''' Don’t worry, it’s just a game.

'''Su:''' So, where’s our next stop, Griseo?

'''Su:''' Of course, to save time, once you confirm the specific destination, I’ll teleport you there directly.
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
</tabber>

<tabber>
|-|[CHOICE] - Discuss the current situation with Su.=
'''Griseo:''' Uncle Su, I’ve been wondering about something.

'''Griseo:''' This is my first time at the Pioneers’ Gathering. But playing cat-and-mouse in the world observed by the 2nd Divine Key has occurred many times in the past.

'''Griseo:''' So I assume Nuwa is acting on the premise that this year’s cat will be me.

'''Griseo:''' If there’s any place that’s perfect for reading yet I avoid, it must be…

…
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
</tabber>

<tabber>
|-|[CHOICE] - School.=
'''Griseo:''' It’s definitely the school!

'''Su:''' …Although a bit tricky to access, Nuwa has indeed been there before.

'''Griseo:''' Hmm… What I meant to say is…

…
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
|-|[CHOICE] - The bookstore in the beginning.=
'''Griseo:''' Nuwa must be at the bookstore we visited first.

'''Su:''' The more dangerous the place, the safer it is?

'''Su:''' It makes sense, but before you entered the bookstore, I had already inspected it inside and out.

'''Su:''' Nuwa is not there.

'''Griseo:''' Ah. If so, then there’s only one possibility left…

…
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
|-|[CHOICE] - A place that Griseo currently can’t access.=
Somehow, even though she had a clear intuition, she still hesitated about revealing the answer.

'''Griseo:''' Nuwa should be at… a place I currently can’t access. For example…

…
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
</tabber>

'''Fuxi:''' Making a minor go to a place like that to find you. How cunning.

'''Fuxi:''' No. This goes beyond being cunning. It’s clearly cheating.

'''Nuwa:''' Hey, hey, I heard that! It’s called being versatile, you know?

Saying this, Nuwa landed her chopsticks on a piece of pan-fried tofu before Fuxi could, split it in half, and smugly popped one half into her mouth.

However, the very next second, the scalding inside of the tofu destroyed her composure.

'''Nuwa:''' Oooh! Oooh! It-It’s so hot!

'''Knight:''' Here’s some cold water.

'''Nuwa:''' Phew… saved.

'''Griseo:''' Nuwa, are you alright?

'''Nuwa:''' Yeah… I’m fine. Mr. Knight’s water saved me. Thank you.

'''Knight:''' You’re most welcome.

'''Su:''' Good thing you didn’t eat too much, or you could’ve really burned your esophagus.

'''Kevin:''' How about I cool down this plate of tofu for you?

'''Hua:''' That’s way too rough!

'''Hua:''' Anyway, let’s try the noodles I made first, or they’ll stick together. As for Nuwa, you can take your time before eating.

'''Nuwa:''' Oooohhh…

'''Hua:''' Griseo, are you learning to use chopsticks? This is a good chance to teach you.

'''Hua:''' With regular practice, you’ll master it in less than half a month.

'''Griseo:''' Okay!

The group chatted casually as they ate, and before long, the food on the table was emptied.

'''Nuwa:''' Ah, I’m so full… Thanks, everyone! I’ll do the dishes later.

'''Fuxi:''' Well, good to know you still have a sense of responsibility.

'''Nuwa:''' Of course, I need the table for tea and chatting. Speaking of which, little Griseo, do you have any new plans after finishing the concept artwork for me?

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' I haven’t decided yet.

'''Nuwa:''' Oh, if my previous statement “Little Griseo loves us so much, of course she wouldn’t want to leave!” is bothering you, then I take it back!

'''Nuwa:''' Whether you choose to live with us here at Mount Taixuan or continue your global travels, we’ll support you either way.

‘’’Nuwa:’’’ By the way, is the Ark still at the launch site of the MOTHs?

'''Su:''' Yes, Kevin and I restarted the automatic repair system left by Vill-V, and in about half a year, the Ark should be restored to its former state.

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Hua:''' Regardless, there’s no rush to make this decision.

'''Hua:''' You’ll have plenty of time to think it over.

'''Griseo:''' Okay, thank you.

The girl replied, yet a particular thought slipped through her fingers like melting ice, tumbled to the ground, and eventually dissipated into a faint wisp of smoke, fading away in the warm sunlight.

As if it had never been born.

'''Knight:''' …

In the afternoon, Nuwa succeeded in pestering Griseo to bring out the finished concept artwork. Although she wasn’t entirely satisfied with it herself, everyone present praised it quite highly.

Regardless, the figure-sculpting process started amidst this a tad too lively atmosphere.

At dinner, Nuwa, still not fully content, took it upon herself to perform the story of “Jingwei”, a myth she wrote.

Perhaps it was the alcohol, but her voice, despite sounding tipsy, carried more power and emotion than usual.

As she finished the story, before the diverse reactions of the audience, Nuwa, wearing a beaming smile, fell into Fuxi’s embrace.

And with that, this day finally came to a close.

…

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight, are you asleep?

'''Knight:''' Not yet. What is it, Griseo?

'''Griseo:''' I… I want to ask you one more question.

'''Knight:''' I’m listening.

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight, what have you been thinking today?

'''Knight:''' It’s about you, I’ll admit, but nothing complex.

'''Knight:''' I just want to know… Griseo, are you happy today?

'''Griseo:''' If it’s just that, you could’ve asked me directly. No need to wait until evening, right?

'''Knight:''' But it’s only considered “one day” when it’s evening, you know.

'''Griseo:''' Well then. Today, I’m really happy.

'''Griseo:''' It’s like walking on cotton candy, where every step is sweet.

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' But, Mr. Knight, I can see that you’re not happy.

'''Griseo:''' Seeing you feeling down made me not that happy anymore.

'''Knight:''' …

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight, is there something bothering you? Would you like to talk to me about it?

'''Knight:''' …

'''Griseo:''' If you’re worried I’ll tell the others, we can do a pinky swear.

'''Knight:''' …Thank you.

'''Knight:''' Thank you, Griseo.

'''Knight:''' It’s a bit late now, and kids shouldn’t stay up too late.

'''Knight:''' But I promise you…

'''Knight:''' When tomorrow comes, I’ll tell you what’s on my mind.

'''Griseo:''' You’ll keep your word, won’t you?

'''Knight:''' I will.

Filled with anticipation for tomorrow, the girl quietly clasped the knight’s pinky and fell fast asleep.

Thus, a new day began…

(But really?)

====<u>Gameplay 41-3 - Cages Under the Sky</u>====
'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' Did I… fall asleep?

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' Ah, dropped the brush.

'''Griseo:''' Ngh!

'''Griseo:''' Head, dizzy…

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' Griseo!

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' Sorry I’m late.

'''Griseo:''' It’s okay, Mr. Knight. I simply had a little stumble. No big deal.

'''Knight:''' Did you get hurt?

'''Griseo:''' Not really.

'''Knight:''' Phew… that’s a relief. Are you still feeling dizzy? Would you like to have something to eat?

As he spoke, the tall knight, as if by magic, pulled out a dainty wooden box from behind him.

'''Knight:''' Nuwa asked me to bring your breakfast. She noticed you hadn’t left the studio all morning and figured you must have pulled an all-nighter painting last night.

'''Griseo:''' Sorry, this won’t happen again.

'''Knight:''' …What am I going to do with you? Anyway, have the meal first.

'''Griseo:''' Okay.

The moment the food box was opened, the delightful aroma of the food instantly filled the air.

Water, pickle, and steaming rice porridge… a simple yet nourishing breakfast, the perfect source of morning energy.

Typically, no one would say no to this carefully prepared breakfast.

'''Griseo:''' Uh…

However, she found it extremely difficult to swallow, with waves of nausea creeping in… as if she had had this same meal many times in a row.

'''Knight:''' Griseo, if you really don’t have an appetite, just take a few sips so you won’t feel hungry.

'''Griseo:''' It’s okay, I’ll take my time and finish it slowly.

'''Griseo:''' Even with her busy schedule, Nuwa still wakes up early every day to prepare breakfast for Fuxi and me.

'''Griseo:''' If I don’t finish it, Nuwa will surely blame herself for it.

'''Knight:''' …I really wish I could share your burden.

'''Griseo:''' Haha, you never know. It might happen someday!

The girl flashed a bright smile at the knight, before resuming her struggle with the seemingly bottomless bowl of rice porridge.

'''Griseo:''' By the way, Mr. Knight, if I recall correctly, today should be…

'''Griseo:''' The day of the Pioneers’ Gathering, isn’t it?

'''Knight:''' …!

'''Knight:''' Indeed, I thought you might have forgotten.

'''Griseo:''' Actually, I just recalled it myself, like stumbling upon a surprise leaf Nuwa tucked into the rice porridge.

'''Griseo:''' Plus, last night, I only stayed up that late to create enough concept artwork for Nuwa to kickstart her figurines today.

'''Knight:''' Don’t worry, you’ve been working at a good pace. Nuwa knows that and has never pressured you.

'''Griseo:''' But I have to keep my word.

'''Griseo:''' Anyway, I’m absolutely determined to finish the final piece tomorrow… without staying up late!

'''Knight:''' And what if you end up staying up late again?

'''Griseo:''' Well, in that case… I guess I’ll have to paint for one more day then…

'''Knight:''' Hahaha.

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight, I finished eating.

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' If you’re ready, let’s set out.

<tabber>
|-|Finished paintings were stacked on the crate, while studies were stacked at the bottom.=
'''Griseo:''' One, two… eight. I just need to do one more study.

'''Griseo:''' I haven’t practiced lately. I must make up for it once I’m less busy.
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
</tabber>

<tabber>
|-|An unfinished painting.=
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
<br>'''Griseo:''' I need to finish it quickly.

<tabber>
|-|A flowing, lively painting.=
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
<br>'''Griseo:''' Why do I have this unfamiliar feeling?
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
</tabber>

'''Griseo:''' Strange… why is my study here?

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' Don’t worry. Let us recover it first.

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' Recovery complete.

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight, I do remember stacking my studies at the bottom.

'''Griseo:''' But… why are they still scattered everywhere?

'''Knight:''' It must be the box itself, I suppose.

'''Knight:''' Throughout this year, it has traveled with us to numerous places.

'''Knight:''' Perhaps rather than the quiet setting recently, it yearns more for our adventurous days.

'''Griseo:''' Haha, you do have a point.

…

…

…

…

'''Griseo:''' Hmm…

'''Griseo:''' The sun is so blinding.

'''???:''' Little Griseo~

…

…

…

'''Griseo:''' Good morning, Nuwa, Fuxi.

'''Nuwa:''' It’s almost noon. Little Griseo, don’t tell me you just woke up.

'''Griseo:''' Uh…

'''Knight:''' Well, actually, Griseo’s artworks decided to take a little stroll in the hallway outside the studio, so we spent some time retrieving them.

'''Nuwa:''' I see. I thought maybe it was the breakfast I made today that was hard for you to stomach.

'''Griseo:''' No, absolutely not!

'''Griseo:''' So… Nuwa, Fuxi, while you were outside, did you happen to come across any other works of mine?

'''Fuxi:''' No. But even if they all ventured beyond the studio, there’s no need to worry.

'''Nuwa:''' Hua, Su, and Kevin are all over there by the stone table having tea. They could take care of them.

'''Griseo:''' That’s good to hear.

'''Nuwa:''' Wait a moment… little Griseo, aren’t you a little too calm?

'''Nuwa:''' It’s been almost a year since you last saw Kevin and Su. When you arrived at Mount Taixuan, even Hua happened to be away dealing with Honkai beasts.

'''Griseo:''' Perhaps it’s because last night I had a…

'''Griseo:''' Had a… hunch.

“Right, it must be a hunch.”

'''Knight:''' …

'''Knight:''' Nuwa, since everyone is here now, how about Griseo and I go to the kitchen garden to get some fresh vegetables?

'''Knight:''' That way, when it’s time to prepare lunch, we won’t have to trouble everyone to go back out.

'''Nuwa:''' That sounds like a plan! I’ll leave it to you, then.

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight, Hua… isn’t at the vegetable garden, right?

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' Yeah. Nuwa just told me that she’s having tea by the stone table.

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' But why are you asking this all of a sudden?

'''Griseo:''' I… I don’t know either…

'''Griseo:''' It’s really… Hua.

'''Hua:''' Griseo and Mr. Knight, it’s been a long time.

'''Griseo:''' Yeah… the same to you.

'''Griseo:''' Hua, weren’t you just having tea with Su and Kevin? Why did you come here?

'''Hua:''' Well, it suddenly occurred to me that I hadn’t checked on the garden. And since we’ll be preparing lunch later, I thought I’d come by for a quick look.

'''Hua:''' Why, did Nuwa send you to find me?

'''Griseo:''' No. Mr. Knight thought it would be a good idea for us to come here first. That way, we won’t have to make an extra trip when it’s time to prepare lunch.

'''Hua:''' Seems we’ve got the same idea.

'''Griseo:''' Yeah.

'''Hua:''' Haha, by the way, since you’re here, would you like to try planting?

'''Griseo:''' Okay.

'''Hua:''' …

'''Hua:''' Griseo, can I ask you a question?

'''Griseo:''' What is it?

'''Hua:''' Have you been taking care of the garden when I’m not around?

'''Griseo:''' No, it’s actually Nuwa… though she hasn’t come here very often either.

'''Hua:''' Looks like you have a knack for farming. You’ve been doing quite well even without my instruction.

'''Hua:''' Is it because you’ve grasped the essence of farming, similar to your understanding of colors?

'''Griseo:''' …?

'''Hua:''' Do you still remember? There was a time in the past when you would adopt the “colors” of people you spent a long time with, reflecting their characteristics in your speech and behavior, essentially becoming like that person.

'''Griseo:''' Hua, I won’t do that again… I promise.

'''Hua:''' No, you misunderstand, Griseo. I just want you to know that back then, I was truly grateful to you.

'''Hua:''' After all, the premise of taking on a person’s colors is having a deep insight into their essence, something even oneself may struggle to perceive.

Hua gently flattened the damp soil underfoot and let out a soft sigh.

'''Hua:''' …After the wildfires in Australia were finally put out, I went through a period of self-doubt.

'''Hua:''' Although I appeared the same as before in the eyes of others, I found myself constantly reflecting on what I, as a survivor every time, could do for all those who had tragically perished.

'''Hua:''' I understood then that this overthinking had little practical significance, but it was also the only motivation keeping me going during those times.

'''Hua:''' Until one day… I met you, who had become another version of me.

'''Hua:''' You reminded me…

'''Hua:''' …

'''???:''' “...I want to know what I can do.”

'''???:''' “Hey… don’t worry, you’ll have a lifetime to figure that out.”

'''Hua:''' What we’re able to do and what we’re willing to do for someone else… they often carry entirely different meanings. And…

'''Hua:''' For whom we do it… Even if we give it our all, we still end up facing failure.

'''Hua:''' After all, we live in the present, yet we undeniably belong to the past.

'''Hua:''' Even though we can keep humanity company for a long time, who can say for sure that we are truly part of them?

'''Griseo:''' Hua, it seems like… you don’t wish to have too deep bonds with the people of this era.

'''Hua:''' I can’t really explain it either.

'''Hua:''' But the time I spend with you all are the happiest and most relaxing for me.

'''Hua:''' In that case, the me of this moment still belongs to the past… and that’s perfectly fine.

'''Griseo:''' Me too.

'''???:''' I’m sorry, but I have to interrupt your conversation for today’s lunch.

'''Griseo:''' (Huh?)

'''Griseo:''' Fuxi… has anything happened to Nuwa?

'''Fuxi:''' Hehe, it seems that when it comes to trouble, everyone invariably thinks of my clumsy little sister.

'''Griseo:''' …Oh, I’m sorry.

'''Fuxi:''' No, she’s the one who should apologise. But since you guessed correctly, Griseo, how about you take her out later?

'''Griseo:''' Huh?

The group quickly gathered around Su.

Fuxi briefly explained what had happened and assigned tasks to everyone present.

'''Fuxi:''' …Mr. Knight, do whatever you can. As for Hua, you’re in charge of today’s lunch, and Kevin and I will assist you.

'''Knight:''' …

'''Knight:''' …In that case, may I go with Griseo?

'''Su:''' Yeah, of course.

'''Griseo:''' Seems like this is a world with a thriving entertainment industry.

'''Griseo:''' Everyone is talking about games, comics, movies, and the like.

'''Su:''' You have a keen eye, Griseo. As you can see, this is also why Nuwa doesn’t want to leave.

'''Su:''' Anyway, it’s a unique opportunity, and if you’re interested, you can explore this world a bit. Just make sure not to interact with people here.

'''Knight:''' Su’s right. It’s a rare opportunity. We can take the chance to learn more about other worlds.

'''Griseo:''' Okay.

'''Griseo:''' Somehow I feel… Mr. Knight is taking the most pleasure in this.

'''Griseo:''' Or you wouldn’t have volunteered to accompany me.

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' Hah… Yeah.

'''Decadent Man:''' Hello? It’s me. I… I have to share something with you?

'''Decadent Man:''' Just a moment ago, I received a letter. It said…

'''Decadent Man:''' “The Julian you’ve portrayed, though a fictional character, has evoked deeply genuine emotions within me.”

'''Decadent Man:''' “Just witnessing his adventures in Gaul fills me with excitement. I feel my life is brimming with energy. And I’m so restless and impatient when eagerly awaiting your updates.”

'''Decadent Man:''' “I understand I shouldn’t intrude into your personal life, but regardless, I sincerely hope you continue writing this remarkable tale.”

'''Decadent Man:''' Did you… did you hear what I just said? There’s actually… actually someone waiting for my updates.

'''Decadent Man:''' But this means… it’ll be even harder for me to give up writing, right?

'''Knight:''' …

'''Knight:''' Griseo, do you think he will keep writing?

'''Griseo:''' For this gray-hued man, this letter is just false hope.

'''Griseo:''' But thanks to this letter, his world has a little splash of happy orange now… even though it’s faint and ready to fade away at any moment.

'''Knight:''' So, your answer is… he will give up?

'''Griseo:''' …Mr. Knight, even extinguished colors can reignite.

'''Griseo:''' What Hua and the others are doing right now is precisely that.

'''Griseo:''' Besides, I don’t think “gray” necessarily equates to “giving up”.

'''Griseo:''' After all, those who have embraced the monotony of gray are often the ones who can see how colorful the world is. It’s like… only those who have sketched can use paint right?

'''Su:''' That’s a good answer. So, do you wish me to tell you what will happen to him next?

'''Griseo:''' There’s no need, Su.

'''Griseo:''' I have faith in him.

'''Girl Who Loves Novels:''' Blood and Sword is just amazing, don’t you think? I have to say, Miss Wei is a true genius!

'''Girl Who Loves Movies:''' You’ve finally finished it! What’s your favorite part? Tell me!

'''Girl Who Loves Novels:''' The most memorable and heart-wrenching part for me is the final long shot of the film.

'''Girl Who Loves Novels:''' Inside the bamboo hut, Ye stared at Bin’s broken sword, which he never parted with. There were no words, no tears. It was as if time had stopped, and thoughts drifted away.

'''Girl Who Loves Novels:''' In the midst of this silence, the faint sound of raindrops outside grew even clearer, and… the end.

'''Girl Who Loves Novels:''' To bring back what they called “hope”, the clumsy Bin told the only lie in his life to Ye, the chef girl, who, despite being a shrewd person, still believed it.

'''Girl Who Loves Novels:''' Although the story is complete and beautiful, I can’t accept this ending…

'''Girl Who Loves Novels:''' …

'''Girl Who Loves Novels:''' I’ve made up my mind! I’m going to give Bin and Ye a better ending!

'''Girl Who Loves Movies:''' Really? That fast?

'''Girl Who Loves Novels:''' I know that Blood and Sword has its share of enthusiastic fan fiction, but the ending I’ve expected in my heart… no one has ever written it until now!

'''Griseo:''' Since no one can write the story she expects, then she shall create one herself…

'''Griseo:''' In this regard, she’s actually quite similar to Nuwa.

'''Knight:''' It’s not about acting for the sake of someone, but about seeing what can be achieved on one’s own.

'''Knight:''' This is what keeps Nuwa motivated every day, right?

'''Su:''' It’s a shame she isn’t here to hear your words.

'''Su:''' Otherwise, we may have been able to have lunch a little earlier.

'''Boy:''' What are you drawing?

'''Girl:''' I’m drawing a world above the blue sky.

'''Boy:''' But apart from the unreachable little dots, there’s nothing there.

'''Boy:''' Why not draw a world under the sea? It’s more interesting.

'''Girl:''' But before ships sailed into the sea, nobody knew there were fish and coral, right?

'''Girl:''' So… who knows what’s really up there in the sky?

'''Griseo:''' …

The young girl recalled something that happened so very long ago.

For almost all the time the Ark sailed, she followed Vill-V’s instructions and slept soundly in the small, secure dormancy capsule.

It was because of this that every time she woke up, she would stand by the window with the best view, painting the world in her eyes with immense anticipation.

However, for the girl’s question, she didn’t have the answer herself either.

Indeed, despite her enduring enthusiasm, she had to acknowledge that throughout the lengthy navigation, each of her paintings had depicted either the vast expanse of darkness or the tiny stars.

…And they were all no different from the previous one, and the one before that.

She hadn’t seen big and soft clouds or played games with gentle swans, diligent hedgehogs, and crabs made of candy.

She simply stood by the window, imagining a world among the starlight.

'''Griseo:''' (So…)

'''Griseo:''' (What really is out there above the sky?)

'''Griseo:''' Hmm…!

…That’s something all of us are still trying to find out.

I still remember Vill-V once half-jokingly said, “If you board this ship, you’ll have an endless supply of subjects to paint.” But when I said I wanted to replace Kosma in executing Project ARK, she immediately changed her attitude.

She knew that no matter how many stars there were, they couldn’t light up the universe, and no matter how skilled the brush was, it couldn’t capture the essence of reality. All she could do was shield me from the truth, which a child couldn’t grasp.

But now, I have my answer.

It might be somewhat childish or naive, but I want to share it with you.

Are you willing to hear it? Hear me?

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' I…

'''Griseo:''' I do.

…

…

As expected, I returned here… the corridor outside the studio.

In my right hand, there was the wooden food box that Nuwa asked me to bring to Griseo.

'''Knight:''' …

'''Knight:''' It seems that the thing that has been causing the time loop still hasn’t reached its limit.

'''Knight:''' But still, Griseo and I have brought it a little closer to that limit.

'''Knight:''' …Let’s just keep trying.

I pumped myself up and started reviewing the events of the previous “today”.

'''Knight:''' On the last “today”, because lunch took some time, I didn’t send Griseo to meet Kevin and Su. Instead, I led her straight to Hua.

'''Knight:''' Since Griseo had already learned how to plant seeds, I knew that it would trigger Hua’s memories and give Griseo some new thoughts.

'''Knight:''' In the cat-and-mouse game that followed, I took the initiative and proposed that Griseo should observe that world.

'''Knight:''' After we listened to the conversation between the little boy and girl, “today” seemed to reset due to certain thoughts of Griseo running counter to the hidden forces.

'''Knight:''' Although this was the fastest reset so far, I couldn’t bear to see Griseo struggling to stomach the food once again.

'''Knight:''' I should probably tip over the food box “by accident”, leaving only a cup fo water… if that’s the case, “today” would proceed as usual.

But in the end, whether it was “business as usual” or a “something different”, it didn’t make much difference to me.

Because the Griseo I know is naturally positive, and as reluctant as she is to leave this place, she will always look forward to tomorrow and the days beyond after a little guidance.

'''Knight:''' …

If you want to draw a crab, you need to draw the waves and the beach first.

If you want to find a door to exit the cycle, you must first find a key that symbolises hope and a heart that’s determined enough.

As her painting, I’m afraid I don’t have something as precious as a heart, and can only hold on tight to my key.

But somehow, as I watched again and again, the colors in front of me became increasingly vivid, as if I had become a painter like Griseo.

The colors spoke to me of their temperatures, tastes, and moods, intertwined into one leaping note after another, kissed and hugged my armor, and sometimes danced around my fingers.

I didn’t know if this was a chain reaction from that night, or a gift secretly given to me by a sweet girl.

The only thing I knew was that, just as she hoped for my happiness, I also wished for her to find genuine happiness.

…

However, reality often seemed to have a penchant for showering everyone with a cold reality check when things were looking up.

The girl who always greeted me with a smile…

Today, she didn’t wake up.

--

====<u>Gameplay 41-4 - Deja Vu</u>====
At this moment, outside of the repeating dream, in the forbidden grounds of Phosphorus and Hesperus…

'''Fu Hua:''' …

Reflecting on all the events that had transpired on her journey, she couldn’t help but release a sigh.

In her career as a detective, she had grown accustomed to surprises and unexpected turns, and her current experiences were no exception.

During her travels, she had found herself in a foreign world due to a peculiar space warp, and with the assistance of the enthusiastic representatives, she had stumbled upon the Ark, which had lost contact with Earth a millennium ago.

In the end, after getting rid of the radiant mist and the mysterious being that sought to take over her body, she finally met the enforcer of Project ARK… Griseo.

Thankfully, the dormancy capsule remained functional, and Griseo within it continued to sleep soundly.

'''Fu Hua:''' …But the most challenging part lies right here.

'''Fu Hua:''' The control panel outside the dormancy capsule is malfunctioning, and forcibly breaking through the shell might harm Griseo.

'''Fu Hua:''' Therefore, at this moment, I have to find another safe way to activate the dormancy capsule from within the Ark.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

Having determined her next step, she didn’t rush into action.

In fact, she was searching within the vast sea of memories for recollections related to the day when the miracle happened…

'''“Expert” Vill-V:''' That’s all. So, does anyone have any questions about Project ARK?

'''Kosma:''' …

'''“Expert” Vill-V:''' Very well, since the enforcer himself doesn’t have any questions, let’s call it a day.

'''Kevin:''' Wait.

'''“Expert” Vill-V:''' What is it?

'''Kevin:''' Vill-V, the presentation gives a very detailed description of what can be done by Project ARK. However, for the most crucial part of this plan, which is what the enforcer should do, your explanation is somewhat vague.

'''Kevin:''' …Why is that?

'''“Expert” Vill-V:''' I see your point, but to be honest, this part doesn’t require an explanation.

'''“Expert” Vill-V:''' In my opinion, anyone with normal logical and cognitive abilities and color recognition skills can be the enforcer of Project ARK.

'''Hua:''' …?

'''“Expert” Vill-V:''' During the initial design phase, I aimed to streamline the complex operating system inside the Ark as much as possible.

'''“Expert” Vill-V:''' Pressing the red number one button allows the Ark to take off, while pressing the green one activates the dormancy capsule… as you can see, it’s quite straightforward, isn’t it?

'''“Expert” Vill-V:''' But of course, if Kosma himself finds it too boring, he can always switch from “beginner mode” to “expert mode”.

'''“Expert” Vill-V:''' Furthermore, I’ve also taken into account all potential unexpected scenarios that the Ark might encounter during its journey, and prepared a variety of portable SOPs, each addressing different categories, plus an AI-powered troubleshooting system.

'''Pardofelis:''' Portable SOPs… are those the ones you had me record?

'''“Expert” Vill-V:''' You’re referring to the “The Most Advanced Engineering Equipment: SOP Compiled by the Greatest Engineer of the Century Who’s Dedicated Half of Her Life to This Book”? That’s just a small part of it… but you’re right.

'''“Expert” Vill-V:''' In any case, even a kid like Griseo, after ten minutes of training, can become a passenger on the Ark.

'''“Expert” Vill-V:''' Hmm, perhaps this example is not quite appropriate. However, this is all the explanation I have for the execution part.

'''Fu Hua:''' According to Vill-V’s description at the time, I should prioritise finding the control panel that can activate the troubleshooting system.

'''Fu Hua:''' After all, the portable SOPs… are more likely to be carried by Griseo.

'''Fu Hua:''' Alright. Time to go.

'''Fu Hua:''' <span style="color:#ffe14b;">Focus</span>. Scout the surroundings first.

'''Fu Hua:''' This console is the same as the one I discovered in the glowing mist.

'''Fu Hua:''' But I couldn’t have accessed internal information without the help of Vi. Now…

'''Fu Hua:''' Overthinking won’t help. At least I should try.

Conducting facial recognition, please wait…

…

Visitor identified as Project EMBER enforcer… Hua. Access authorised. Control panel initiating…

'''Fu Hua:''' Wait a moment, did I… already have access to the Ark system?

She suddenly remembered her recent conversation with Vi regarding the bug…

'''Vi:''' Haha, I mean it. That mist you’re seeing is just an illusion concealing the truth. And, well, the shape this trick takes? That depends on you.

'''Vi:''' As for the console… That’s actually real, a rare flaw in the illusion. That’s why I call it a bug. Does that make sense?

'''Fu Hua:''' …So, in fact, Vi’s assistance wasn’t the crucial part at all.

'''Fu Hua:''' My focus at that time was on the “bug” that I overlooked the crucial part of Vi’s words… “the console is actually real”. This allowed her to exploit the situation.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Considering the circumstances, I should take a look at what the console has to offer.

This process didn’t take much time.

As Vill-V mentioned, the complex internal operating systems of the Ark have been significantly simplified. Therefore, the info displayed on the screen right now was only a few recommended options represented by simple numbers.

'''Fu Hua:''' …That’s it!

<tabber>
|-|[CHOICE] - Troubleshoot=

<div style="line-height: 15px"></div>
'''Troubleshooter:''' Please begin your query with “Question:”, and I shall endeavor to provide an answer.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Question: Is there any way to open the dormancy capsule if the control panel on the outside is not working?

'''Troubleshooter:''' …

'''Troubleshooter:''' Clarification: Is your ultimate objective awaking the pilot within the dormancy capsule?

'''Fu Hua:''' …Yes.

'''Troubleshooter:''' Prepare yourself psychologically for the scenario where the pilot may not regain consciousness after leaving the chamber.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Troubleshooter:''' Additional info: The pilot has been in hibernation for a total of 561,397 days. During this period, as the Ark has remained in a landed state, the system has made multiple attempts to awaken her, each of which has concluded in failure.

'''Troubleshooter:''' Perhaps her consciousness has perpetually remained in a state of hibernation within her body. Perhaps…

'''Fu Hua:''' I don’t need “perhaps”.

'''Fu Hua:''' …Just tell me how to open the dormancy capsule.

'''Troubleshooter:''' If you are mentally prepared, please proceed to the control console at the end of the corridor where the power supply system is located. Disconnect the dormancy capsule from the auxiliary power system. This will deactivate all modules within the dormancy capsule and force the chamber door to open.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' …

Even though she knew the answer now, Fu Hua just stood there staring at the ground, frozen in silence for almost three minutes.

She knew the worst-case scenario that might happen… a total mental breakdown.

Once something like that happened, there’d be no turning back. Whether it’s the Herrscher of Sentience or the Herrscher of the End, they’d all prove unhelpful.

After all, it’s like how time can empower gentle breezes and dripping water to gradually reshape even the toughest rocks.

But the bits that got carried away would vanish without a trace, never to return again in this world.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Wait, the way things are right now…

'''Fu Hua:''' …It’s just way too suspicious.

<div style="line-height: 15px"></div>
'''Fu Hua:''' From the surveillance footage, the gene bank appears to be intact.

'''Fu Hua:''' However, the indicator light that signifies its normal operation is off!

'''Fu Hua:''' Question: Is there an issue with the Ark’s power supply system?

'''Troubleshooter:''' Inquiry identified. Response coming up.

'''Troubleshooter:''' The current power efficiency of the Ark stands at 18.7%, which reflects a decrease of 0.46% compared to yesterday. It is recommended to activate the in-situ resource collection system immediately or suspend the use of the dormancy capsule.

'''Fu Hua:''' Why… the dormancy capsule?

'''Troubleshooter:''' The dormancy capsule has the highest energy consumption among all facilities aboard the Ark. Presently, the Ark’s primary engine remains unlocated, and without intervention, the energy reserves of the auxiliary power system are projected to deplete within a few years.

'''Fu Hua:''' (The main engine is unaccounted for… Does that mean it’s essentially running on backup power? But given the Ark’s design, why would the main engine…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (No, that’s not the point here.)

'''Fu Hua:''' If the gene bank can’t operate normally due to insufficient power supplies on the Ark, then wouldn’t all the genetic samples from that era be at risk?

'''Troubleshooter:''' Error detected, correction in progress.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Troubleshooter:''' The gene bank contains 3,844 sets of flora and fauna genetic resources and 216 sets of human genetic samples, all of which have been fully utilised.

'''Fu Hua:''' What…

In an instant, a dreadful feeling gripped her. She was gasping for air, yet still attempting to use her wits to shake it off.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Question: Who initiated the use of the gene bank?

'''Troubleshooter:''' It’s the Enforcer of Project ARK… Griseo.

'''Fu Hua:''' Then, does the monitoring system have recorded footage from that time?

'''Troubleshooter:''' Regrettably, due to the extended operation of the monitoring system, the footage from that time has been entirely overwritten and cannot be retrieved.

'''Troubleshooter:''' But I can furnish you with the comprehensive navigation log of the Ark since its inception. It operates on a distinct storage principle compared to visual recordings and may provide you with additional information.

'''Fu Hua:''' That’d be a great help. Please display it for me now.

As she replayed the scene in her mind, she did her best to rattle off the ID numbers in the right order, from those recent navigation logs she’d skimmed through in the bug.

What surprised her was that the system’s recorded logs matched Vi’s presentation down to the last detail.

'''Fu Hua:''' So, when it comes down to it, there can be only two possibilities…

'''Fu Hua:''' On one hand, Vi could’ve cooked up this history and made it all work even after she left, which sounds pretty complicated. On the other hand, Vi might not have lied at all. She simply showed the info as it was stored in the system.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Regardless of what Griseo went through during the Ark’s descent, the end result was that she peacefully slept in the dormancy capsule, without a scratch. However, it’s an undeniable fact that all the genetic samples within the gene bank have been fully utilised.

'''Fu Hua:''' Assuming that Griseo is indeed the one who accessed the gene bank, then from that moment onward, she had no reason to remain in hibernation.

'''Fu Hua:''' Therefore, the most likely scenario is that someone stole Griseo’s authorisation during her hibernation period… Maybe that person was responsible for Griseo being trapped in the dormancy capsule.

At this point, the images of two individuals suddenly flashed through her mind.

Vi, who had a deep understanding of the forbidden area, and…. That woman who had always appeared in the Vitas’ memories but had never actually shown up.

'''Fu Hua:''' However, regardless of who the culprit might be, that person’s attitude toward Griseo raises many puzzling questions.

'''Fu Hua:''' For instance, why did they keep Griseo in a state of hibernation all this time? Of course, that’s something to be thankful for. After all, from a conventional criminal perspective…

'''Fu Hua:''' …

|-|[CHOICE] - Access the monitoring system of the Ark’s corridor=
<div style="line-height: 15px></div><br>
</tabber>
<div style="line-height: 15px"></div>
The moment Fu Hua tapped the screen, she immediately felt a subtle vibration, and there was definitely something that had fallen deep within the corridor due to it.

Yet, the screen itself remained unchanged.

'''Fu Hua:''' Seems like the monitoring system in the corridor is malfunctioning.

'''Fu Hua:''' As for that noise just now… I’ll go and check it out.

'''Fu Hua:''' This fragment…

'''Fu Hua:''' I feel like I’ve seen it somewhere before.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Wait, could it be…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Ah… Fu Hua, we should probably have introduced this exhibit to you first.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' After all, the entire city of Phosphorus is built on it.

'''Fu Hua:''' …Huh?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' This isn’t a regular stone, but a meteor fragment that brought forth new life.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Yeah. It’s a slice of history that everyone in Phosphorus knows.

'''Fu Hua:''' If the fragments of the Ark are indeed what the Vitas referred to as the ones that brought forth new life…

'''Fu Hua:''' Then Qiming, also known as “Phosphorus”, must be a product of the Ark’s seeding.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

Her recent hunch had just been proven right, but her current mood was far from being at ease.

The truth had now put the one she had least wanted to suspect in the spotlight, awaiting judgment…

'''Fu Hua:''' By the way, what does “representative” stand for?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' A representative is… a representative. We are responsible for providing public services.

'''Fu Hua:''' Does it mean you represent other citizens?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' You can say that. The history of this city dates back to the myth of the world’s creation. We can’t afford to let such a long-lasting civilisation end.

'''Fu Hua:''' Now thinking back, even though the Vitas had a passionate commitment to the city and the job, they never disclosed who they were stepping in for.

'''Fu Hua:''' Meanwhile, that person’s attitude toward the representatives was also quite peculiar.

'''Fu Hua:''' She was willing to grant the representatives the symbol of authorities, the key, yet she didn’t allow them to use it to access the forbidden area and investigate the Ark. In other words, she didn’t want them to know everything inside, especially the existence of the Ark and Griseo.

'''Fu Hua:''' But looking at it from a different angle, since Griseo is right here and untouched… is that person really afraid of the representatives knowing the truth about the city’s origin?

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Forget it. Instead of pondering here, it might be better to go back and just ask Cyan and Orange directly.

'''Fu Hua:''' Now… there’s just one investigation option left.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

<tabber>
|-|[CHOICE] - Access the monitoring system of the bedroom=
<div style="line-height: 15px></div><br>
</tabber>
<div style="line-height: 15px"></div>
'''Fu Hua:''' Wait…

'''Fu Hua:''' Why… is there monitoring in the bedroom?

'''Troubleshooter:''' Inquiry identified, responses imminent.

'''Troubleshooter:''' The Ark has only one pilot. If this individual experiences health issues and the system fails to respond promptly and intervene, the consequences would be dire.

'''Troubleshooter:''' The deployment of monitoring systems throughout the Ark is fundamentally aimed at preventing such situations from occurring.

'''Fu Hua:''' I understand, thanks for your explanation.

'''Fu Hua:''' However, are you absolutely certain that after the second launch of the Ark, there was only one pilot on board?

'''Troubleshooter:''' Affirmative.

'''Fu Hua:''' Then… who is this “Marvin”?

'''Troubleshooter:''' In the Ark’s navigation logs, there are 328 entries referencing “Marvin”. Would you like me to retrieve them for you?

'''Fu Hua:''' Ah… That won’t be necessary.

'''Fu Hua:''' If possible, could you please assist me in locating the logs that feature depictions of Marvin’s appearance?

'''Troubleshooter:''' 23 logs featuring depictions of Marvin’s appearance found. Retrieving…

The moment the 23 paintings lined up in sequence on the screen, Fu Hua was stunned.

It wasn’t because Marvin’s image was particularly astonishing or because the emotions conveyed in the paintings were too moving.

Griseo was simply documenting everything as it was.

It was precisely this raw authenticity that finally made Fu Hua realise a fact that couldn’t have been more obvious.

From the perspective that was glaringly evident before her, Project ARK might have been the most challenging of all the plans proposed by the Previous Era.

She not only overlooked this fact, but also underestimated Griseo, who had returned with the Ark thousands of years ago and had made the determination to set sail once more.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Time to go. No matter what, I cannot keep Griseo waiting any longer.

'''Fu Hua:''' Yeah.

'''Fu Hua:''' The girl who always hid and painted in the art studio has long become…

'''Fu Hua:''' A remarkable hero.

--

====<u>Gameplay 41-5 - Color of Tomorrow</u>====
Everyone always said that everything started as pure white.

It was the case for the light that divided day and night. It was also the case for the cloth where colors would bloom.

But why was there only darkness in front of my eyes now?

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' What’s wrong… with me?

'''Nuwa:''' Does little Griseo want to read comics with me too?

'''Nuwa:''' That would be awesome! I love chatting while reading comics.

'''Griseo:''' Thanks, Mr. Knight!

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' If you want to read more, next time… I mean, we’ve got plenty of time.

'''Griseo:''' What… is this?

'''Hua:''' Griseo, you use chopsticks really well.

'''Griseo:''' Huh?

'''Nuwa:''' Could it be you’ve been secretly practicing the whole night just to show off today?

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Nuwa:''' Y-Y-You… Are you a detective of some sort? You came too soon!

'''Nuwa:''' I just read a dozen pages.

'''Griseo:''' Sorry, this must be my gut instinct.

'''Griseo:''' Gut instinct?

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' Griseo, Griseo…!

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight… Are you there?

'''Mr. Knight:'''''' Griseo, are you happy today?

'''Griseo:''' I’m really happy.

'''Griseo:''' It’s like walking on cotton candy, where every step is sweet.

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' I hope tomorrow…

'''Griseo:''' Will be as happy as today…

'''Griseo:''' Hmm…

The moment she merged into that ball of light, she felt much lighter, like there was some intangible power gently holding her body and lifting her forward.

Again and again, black mist would seep into the light during this process, and steal her most precious treasures… memories… before hiding somewhere she couldn’t go.

But this time, the black mist never came.

The fluffy light kept carry her forward, swimming into the pitch-black night.

There, she saw the memories stolen by the black mist: They had formed multicolored memory clouds, raining emotion bubbles with various smells.

Some of the bubbles made people happy, some annoyed, and some upset…

But most of them somehow made one lonely.

At the end of her journey, she came across a little crab that was able to speak.

“Why leave?” The little crab held up its pincers that were made of candy, and waved them at her. “Weren’t you happy there?”

After some serious contemplation, she answered:

“Before I leave, I can’t know whether I would be happy outside.”

“But if I only stop because of potential sadness along the way, I will definitely miss out on all the happiness in this world.”

“Bon voyage then.” The little crab nodded, before retreating into the night.

Meanwhile, she continued to swim toward the daylight…

'''Knight:''' Griseo! Finally, you’re awake!

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight…

'''Griseo:''' Good morning…?

'''Knight:''' (You…)

'''Knight:''' Now, it should be “good afternoon”.

'''Griseo:''' Mmm, have I slept that long?

'''Knight:''' Yeah. You’ve slept for a really long time, so long that I was getting scared.

'''Griseo:''' Sorry… I won’t do it again.

'''Griseo:''' I only slept in this time because I hadn’t been sound asleep for an eternity.

'''Knight:''' Really? I thought it was just a white lie Su made up to console me.

'''Griseo:''' Uncle Su wouldn’t do that.

'''Griseo:''' You’re always wound up so tightly, Mr. Knight.

'''Knight:''' Perhaps.

'''Knight:''' In any case, let’s focus on you first. How are you feeling?

'''Griseo:''' I’m feeling great. I even think I can finish the last painting tonight.

The knight paused, then poked her forehead with the top of his finger.

'''Knight:''' Kids shouldn’t stay up late.

'''Griseo:''' I know, Mr. Knight.

'''Griseo:''' But Griseo…

'''Griseo:''' She hasn’t been a kid for a long, long time.

'''Knight:''' Hmm…?

Right at that moment, the knight suddenly found that something had long changed quietly in a place that had escaped his attention.

But he didn’t have time to ponder.

For Griseo had grasped his cold iron hands with an expression he had never seen before.

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight…

'''Griseo:''' I have recalled some of those truths that you couldn’t tell me explicitly.

'''Griseo:''' Though it couldn’t be compared to the “todays” that you remember, I do want to strive for it together with you this time.

'''Knight:''' …

For a moment, the knight fell silent.

He could feel some kind of gentle current that was long left behind getting mixed in the paint that formed him.

…

A painting doesn’t have something as precious as a heart, it told itself.

Then why did the colors that had reflected in its eyes become silent and even somewhat bitter just now?

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight, be happier in times like this, okay?

'''Griseo:''' Besides, we have won half the battle.

'''Knight:''' What…?

'''Griseo:''' In the past, whenever the thought of leaving occurred to me, “this day” just refused to let me say goodbye to everyone. It would put an end to everything by force and bring me back to the start.

'''Griseo:''' But now, I don’t know why… It didn’t do that.

'''Griseo:''' So… It’s actually a rare opportunity, yes?

'''Knight:''' …That’s right.

'''Griseo:''' Then, let me do that.

'''Knight:''' Don’t you need me… to keep you company?

As usual, it hinted at something, and anticipated an answer somewhere deep down.

'''Griseo:''' No need. I need to rely on myself alone sometimes.

'''Knight:''' …

This is fine, it told itself. It was true, as Griseo said, that she wasn’t a child anymore.

Yet as her figure receded, an image rapidly unfurled before the knight’s eyes.

It was a picture scroll that dated back thousands of years. Despite its dullness, it still contained the strokes and emotions all too familiar to the knight.

Perhaps the scroll had always been here. And it was merely because of the choice she and it both made…

That it returned to reality.

'''Griseo:''' Hua.

'''Hua:''' Griseo?

'''Hua:''' How did you sleep?

'''Griseo:''' It’s probably the best one in my whole life.

'''Hua:''' You almost gave Mr. Knight a heart attack.

'''Hua:''' Even Nuwa took advantage of the chance to reprimand me for coming back in rugged clothes.

'''Hua:''' Anyways, in terms of looking after ourselves, we both need to pay more attention so that those who care about us won’t always worry sick.

'''Griseo:''' You’re right!

'''Griseo:''' On that note, Hua, can I ask you a question?

'''Hua:''' Certainly.

'''Griseo:''' Well, the thing is…

'''Griseo:''' When sleeping in the dormancy capsule, I would always put on the jade pendant you gave me. Do you know why?

'''Hua:''' Because… you think it can bless you with a safe journey?

'''Griseo:''' Only partly correct.

'''Hua:''' …

'''Hua:''' Well then, does this jade pendant give you a sense of security?

'''Hua:''' Just like good old times. You always like to sort out and pile the gifts everyone gave you up on the bed to make a space of your own.

'''Griseo:''' …Yeah.

'''Griseo:''' But you ignored the most important part.

'''Hua:''' …?

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' I choose to put it on because it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling, just like you do.

'''Griseo:''' Even fast asleep, this warmth will keep reminding me that I’m still in a dream.

'''Griseo:''' But now, even if I had already realised that this was a dream I created, I still couldn’t feel the warmth of the jade pendant…

'''Griseo:''' That means… something horrible must have happened outside.

'''Hua:''' …

'''Hua:''' So… everything here is just part of your dream, including me.

'''Hua:''' So it’s true…

'''Griseo:''' I’m sorry, Hua.

'''Hua:''' Why do you apologise? Do you think that you shouldn’t tell me the truth?

'''Griseo:''' No. Instead, I think I should have told you far, far earlier.

'''Griseo:''' That way, you would be free of being trapped here in this day with me.

'''Hua:''' You’re wrong, Griseo.

'''Hua:''' Regardless of how many times you ask me, my answer would not change.

'''Hua:''' “The time spent with you all is when I feel the happiest and most relaxed.”

'''Griseo:''' I feel the same, Hua.

'''Griseo:''' Next, I should look for Nuwa.

'''Griseo:''' But even if I don’t, she’ll come to me in a hurry, won’t she?

'''Griseo:''' Nuwa, Fuxi.

'''Nuwa:''' Aww, little Griseo!

'''Griseo:''' Ugh!

Before Griseo had the chance to explain the reason for her being here, she was already in Nuwa’s arms.

'''Nuwa:''' Little Griseo, sorry, asking you to complete so many paintings at once was a lapse of judgment on my part this time.

'''Nuwa:''' Despite my intense anticipation of getting my hands on those paintings… I don’t ever want to see history repeat itself.

'''Fuxi:''' Griseo, Nuwa has been blaming herself for an entire morning.

'''Fuxi:''' But fortunately, it seems that you ended up sleeping in just because you were exhausted.

'''Fuxi:''' Otherwise, there would be yet another poor soul with no shut-eye tonight.

'''Griseo:''' I’m sorry for worrying you guys.

'''Nuwa:''' Don’t say that. What matters is that you’re fine now. But, judging by your look, you have something else to say?

'''Fuxi:''' Let me guess… It has something to do with your plan for later?

'''Griseo:''' Yeah, you’re right.

'''Griseo:''' I’m going to leave here with Mr. Knight, since all of this is just in my dream.

'''Nuwa:''' …Fuxi, what do you think?

'''Fuxi:''' Griseo won’t lie. Strangely, I felt proud when she said that out loud.

'''Griseo:''' Fuxi…

'''Fuxi:''' But, now that you have realised this is your dreamland, those created by your imagination like us should soon be merged into your memory again.

'''Fuxi:''' And before that…

All of a sudden, Fuxi turned around and eyed her sister, Nuwa.

'''Fuxi:''' Maybe the me outside of this dream has gotten her answer, but the me right here still has no idea about it. So, I want to ask you.

'''Fuxi:''' Nuwa, what on earth does creating a myth mean to you?

'''Nuwa:''' …

'''Nuwa:''' So that’s what you wanted to ask all along? I thought you were going to ask me something important.

'''Fuxi:''' Well, I kept stalling until now just because it’s kind of trivial.

'''Nuwa:''' Fine… Seeing as you’re suddenly so serious, I can’t brush this aside either.

Thus, with her gaze fixated on the lotus floating in the pool, Nuwa pondered in silence for several minutes.

Until the lotus leaves swayed softly from the caress of the breeze.

'''Nuwa:''' Fuxi, we’re mere mortals after all. In times of the birth of a new civilisation like now, it’s already a miracle to live one hundred years.

'''Nuwa:''' A hundred years may mean nothing to a civilisation. But for us, it’s long enough.

'''Nuwa:''' As you know, I’m not always so responsible like Hua. Be it the future or the past, I don’t plan to let them influence my life.

'''Nuwa:''' If I had a choice, I would never ever accept a job solely driven by sheer willpower and faith without remuneration.

'''Nuwa:''' …By the way, would you accept that?

'''Fuxi:''' If there’s a choice, no one would.

'''Nuwa:''' Therefore, when I finally came to realise that, an idea brewed in my head: If it’s so difficult to carry on, why don’t I create a world where everyone can carry on happily?

'''Nuwa:''' I want to change the minds of everyone in the future so that they will pass on what we once had.

'''Nuwa:''' I want not only for the efforts of the Pioneers to be acclaimed by everyone, but also for those in the distant future to create what I love most.

'''Nuwa:''' Figures, manga, novels, as well as games… I need them all to forever exist in the civilisation and be the undying monument for everyone, which is how my creation initiated, and…

'''Nuwa:''' …What a Pioneer means to me.

'''Fuxi:''' How self-centered.

'''Fuxi:''' …But that doesn’t sound so bad.

'''Nuwa:''' Well, of course!

'''Nuwa:''' Even three, four, or five thousand years later… my legends will still be etched into this very land.

'''Nuwa:''' And one day…

'''Nuwa:''' They will know that it’s not impossible to fill up the ocean and catch up to the sun.

'''Nuwa:''' As for if they can do it better…

'''Fuxi:''' Griseo, I’m counting on you to tell us with a painting then.

'''Griseo:''' Sure…

'''Griseo:''' And then…

'''Griseo:''' It’s Uncle Kevin and Uncle Su.

'''Kevin:''' Griseo, it’s been a while.

'''Griseo:''' A while indeed, Uncle Kevin, Uncle Su.

'''Su:''' I never thought that we would part ways again so soon when we had just reunited.

'''Griseo:''' Uncle Su… is this also one of your abilities?

'''Su:''' Not at all. Your eyes speak for themselves.

'''Su:''' There isn’t suspicion or confusion in your gaze. Instead, it’s brimming with your anticipation for the future, just like when you decided to leave our temporary settlement and travel alone last year.

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' I was really grateful to you for taking care of me at that time. And I still am.

'''Kevin:''' Taking care? Far from it.

'''Kevin:''' After all, apart from a rather simple room, some short company, as well as the ending of one old friend after another…

'''Kevin:''' We left nothing for you, Griseo.

'''Griseo:''' Uncle Kevin…

'''Su:''' Truth be told, it was you who outran the ghosts from the past on that sunny afternoon.

'''Su:''' Though there’s still a long and winding road to integrating with this new yet strange world and knowing where your future lies, you will neither stop moving because of sadness nor linger in a dream for a brief taste of bliss.

'''Griseo:''' …!

'''Su:''' If you ask me, that is more of an ability.

'''Su:''' But, even if it’s just a dream, once there’s a will, the thread intertwining the reality and the dreamland will not break easily.

'''Kevin:''' Heh…

'''Kevin:''' Yeah.

'''Kevin:''' It has been there all along.

'''Griseo:''' The only ones left are us.

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight.

'''Griseo:''' That's enough, fair lady and brave lamb.

'''Griseo:''' Leave the rest to Mr. Knight and me.

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight, I’m back.

'''Knight:''' Welcome back, Griseo. Did your… farewell go smoothly?

'''Griseo:''' Yes, everyone is gone now.

'''Knight:''' …!

'''Knight:''' That’s…

'''Knight:''' That’s… unprecedented.

'''Griseo:''' But maybe this is just the beginning.

'''Knight:''' …?

'''Griseo:''' Mr. Knight, do you still remember how we came to this day?

'''Knight:''' Certainly. After the Ark returned, we lived with Kevin and Su for a month at first.

'''Knight:''' Right after that, we began our year-long journey. At Shenzhou, we came across Nuwa and Fuxi, and accepted their offer to live on Mount Taixuan for a while.

'''Knight:''' During our stay there, something must have happened that caused us to be trapped in “today”.

'''Griseo:''' But that’s not the truth of it.

'''Griseo:''' After bidding everyone goodbye, I recalled more details about “today” and finally came to realise what had led us to it.

'''Knight:''' Is that so?

'''Griseo:''' The Griseo in reality already had a detailed plan for her future before she left Mount Taixuan. Not long after that, she really put her idea into practice.

'''Knight:''' And she decided to proceed with Project ARK?

'''Griseo:''' Yes. After that, Griseo embarked on the fully repaired Ark again and started her journey following a brand new route.

'''Griseo:''' However, one day long after that, a great power captured the Ark and trapped her in hibernation.

'''Griseo:''' The jade pendant she cherished so much was also lost during the process, nowhere to be found.

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo (?):''' Though she had me, she was still all alone on that ship right from the start.

'''Griseo (?):''' When she gradually lost consciousness, I, the palest one, had a spiritual body for the first time.

'''Griseo (?):''' But I was not happy at all, since I represented her loneliness and helplessness; the more complete I was, the less I could represent Griseo.

'''Griseo (?):''' To protect her, I took advantage of all the colors I got from her to shield her from the assault of darkness and create her favorite day with the other colors she unconsciously got on me.

'''Griseo (?):''' I knew that I would forget everything once I was devoid of colors. Thus, at the very end, I left a draft as a precautionary measure against emergencies.

'''Griseo (?):''' It’s just that I didn’t think that those colors, maybe with some other unknown elements mixed in them, caused my initial intention to do a complete one-eighty…

'''Griseo (?):''' They blurred the weight of the term “favorite” all on their own, and proceeded to put the filter of “forever” on a single day.

'''Griseo (?):''' What happened after… I guess you already know, Mr. Knight.

'''Griseo (?):''' Or should I call you… the real Griseo?

'''Knight (?):''' …?

'''Knight (?):''' I don’t understand. I’m… the knight… you created. Isn’t that so?

It told itself.

'''Griseo (?):''' You just used colors akin to Ato’s and created a protective shell of a knight for yourself. Or maybe… it’s because we are here and can’t unite as one that everything turns out like this.

'''Griseo (?):''' But even with that being said… I have no clue how the real Ato talks, as you were so young at that time and didn’t have so many colors.

'''Griseo (?):''' But… I do know how Griseo talks now.

'''Griseo (?):''' After all, the one who understands you the most must be me, who kept you company ever since the Ark set sail.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Crack*

Something seemed to have broken.

And the animated colors that always surrounded its armor finally poured into this crack.

Yes. In this dream that endlessly repeats a day, there was one person who knew the passing of time all along. But her memories about herself had also been stolen by some mysterious power.

And when she finally remembered everything…

'''“Knight”:''' …

'''“Knight”:''' You’re…

'''“Knight”:'''' My gray color? Marvin?

'''Griseo (?):''' You finally remembered.

'''Pure White Griseo:''' But, before I take all the colors back, please call me “Pure White”.

'''Pure White Griseo:''' My personality is far more positive than gray now, after all.

'''Pure White Griseo:''' And more like the past you.

'''“Knight”:''' Haha, sure.

'''“Knight”:''' I think you’re right, Pure White.

'''“Knight”:''' Before the absolute power, at the seemingly last moment… Even after such a long journey, I was still calling for father and mother subconsciously, trying to hide behind their backs.

'''“Knight”:''' This thick armor… Though it probably subdued my fear, it also rendered my self-recognition and memories nearly nonexistent.

'''“Knight”:''' Therefore, on the first “today”, Griseo the “Knight” met Marvin the Pure White.

'''Pure White Griseo:''' But that wasn’t your fault. We both felt that power, the real culprit.

'''“Knight”:''' Oh… You must have been mistaken.

'''“Knight”:''' Even now, I still hold the opinion that… I was indeed on cloud nine that day in the dream. Though this kind of pleasure is doomed to fade away as that day replays again and again.

'''“Knight”:''' I once tried to utter that part of the truth I knew and ask for your help; I even tried to take you out of Mount Taixuan directly… But they all proved to be fruitless.

'''“Knight”:''' The instant the truth came to light, the second I was out of Mount Taixuan, that power would always press rewind.

'''“Knight”:''' Worse still, after I tried this and that, you would faint without rhyme or reason come the next day. Nothing I said could awaken you.

'''Pure White Griseo:''' …Just like “today”, right?

'''“Knight”:''' Yes. After that experience, I acknowledged that if that was the side effect of the cycle… then it would be pointless to fight it head-on.

'''“Knight”:''' Thus, I began to take advantage of my immunity to the cycle and my memories to direct you to the way out.

'''“Knight”:''' I thought that maybe the cycle would end itself if you could entertain the idea of leaving.

'''“Knight”:''' …Shame that that idea also failed.

'''“Knight”:''' That made me realise that that power could only exist outside of today, seeing as all our efforts to end the cycle ended up being futile.

'''“Knight”:''' Maybe it’s some kind of device, or an ability of some sort. It’s outside of today and can’t be affected by us. But…

'''“Knight”:''' Precisely because of that, it’s impossible for it, whatever it is, to make today forever be today. If we just downright give up, we fall right into its trap.

'''Pure White Griseo:''' Therefore, even if no one would ever know the truth, no one could help you out, and the thing that kept you functioning was merely an assumption…

'''Pure White Griseo:''' …Every today, you will guide me while leaving no trace, waiting for the change to come in a slow, gentle fashion.

'''“Knight”:''' Oh… I assure you I’m not so stoic. You know, I had the thought that I was some Mr. Knight, not really existing in reality.

'''“Knight”:''' On a today long long ago, I also planned to stay silent and not direct your thoughts, solely enjoying a good time with friends like the first today.

'''“Knight”:''' …But in the end, I couldn’t do that.

'''“Knight”:''' I just couldn’t stop myself from worrying about you, about our future. And those troubles hiding beneath the armor never escaped your sharp eyes.

'''“Knight”:''' You said that you were not happy because I wasn’t.

'''“Knight”:''' So, I decided to keep going in order to give you a taste of pure happiness.

'''Pure White Griseo:''' …I see.

'''Pure White Griseo:''' When you walk out of Kevin’s house, you should be feeling the same, right?

'''Pure White Griseo:''' That day, you just suddenly deemed the weather nice enough for a walk.

'''Pure White Griseo:''' And so… you began the journey around the world.

'''“Knight”:''' …

''[CG plays wherein Pure White Griseo is absorbed back into Griseo the “Knight”, facilitating her awakening from the dormancy capsule:''

'''''“Knight”:''' Yes, the sunlight outside is perfect.''

'''''“Knight”:''' We… should wake up now.''

'''''Pure White Griseo:''' Even though there’s still a chance of failure this time?''

'''''“Knight”:''' Mhm. Even if we fail this time, I’ll be with you…''

'''''Griseo:''' Until we both witness the real sun.'']

…

Past ghosts, wild dreams, rapture and anguish… Everything stilled in the gentle white glow.

Like the silent universe. Like the mute stars.

The knight embraced solitude.

…And returned to herself.

====<u>Gameplay 41-6 - A Long While</u>====
'''Griseo:''' I need to confirm what time it is.

'''Griseo:''' If I recall correctly, the console is over there…

'''Griseo:''' Huh?

…

'''Griseo:''' …Footsteps?

'''Fu Hua:''' Griseo!

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' Hua?

'''Fu Hua:''' Thank goodness, you’re fine!

'''Fu Hua:''' I’m so happy!

'''Griseo:''' Yeah, I’m fine. Thank you, Hua.

'''Griseo:''' My body still feels a little weak. But apart from that, everything is good. And…

'''Griseo:''' Long time no see?

'''Fu Hua:''' Yes, long time no see.

'''Fu Hua & Griseo:''' Haha.

'''Fu Hua & Griseo:''' Hahahaha.

The two exchanged all the information they currently had.

'''Griseo:''' So, the dormancy capsule only stopped functioning because you severed the connection between it and the power system… And our enemy also fiddled with it.

'''Fu Hua:''' Yeah. However, even if I wasn’t here, as long as you held on for just a while longer, the power system would have stopped running due to your energy consumption in the cycle.

'''Fu Hua:''' I just helped you move the finishing line a little closer. On the contrary, if you had given up struggling, then nothing I did could change the ending.

'''Griseo:''' It’s all thanks to Marvin.

'''Griseo:''' If it hadn’t created this day at the beginning, my mind would have long succumbed to the nothingness of the dark. Just like those paintings… left collecting dust in the corners of the museum.

'''Fu Hua:''' …Marvin, huh?

'''Fu Hua:''' At first, I thought it was a new friend that you made during the maintenance period of the Ark, akin to a mechanical assistant.

'''Fu Hua:''' Only when the system displayed the paintings related to Marvin on the screen did I realise that loneliness could have so many forms.

'''Fu Hua:''' It can be a gray bird playing hide-and-seek among the stars, a withering flower, a dancing painting brush, or a round-headed robot…

'''Fu Hua:''' …And of course, most of all, it’s also you.

'''Griseo:''' Yes.

'''Griseo:''' Though Marvin can’t speak to anyone else but me, I can tell you what it said.

'''Griseo:''' It said: “Thank you for finding Griseo.”

'''Griseo:''' “And thank you for finding me.”

'''Fu Hua:''' Oh… How… chivalrous.

'''Griseo:''' Yeah, but…

As Griseo left the words unsaid, Fu Hua also seemed to notice something, her face flashing with imperceptible worry.

But before long, a smile curled Griseo’s lips again.

Because she believed that when a certain distant past finally reached this moment, it must have already embraced an ending with no regret.

…Be it for the other Pioneers, or for the Hua that was right in front of her.

'''Griseo:''' Hua, let’s wrap up the small talk and get back on topic.

'''Fu Hua:''' Sure. About the current situation… There are still so many things we need to know.

'''Griseo:''' Do you know why you’re here?

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' Judging by your tone, you seem to have already known the answer.

'''Griseo:''' Yes. Though you’ve formed a rough idea of why you’re here, I still need to add that…

'''Griseo:''' You’re not the complete Hua now.

'''Fu Hua:''' What do you mean?

'''Griseo:''' The colors on you somehow seem translucent and are attached to another color which I’m very familiar with.

'''Griseo:''' To put it in another way, it’s highly likely that the real Hua is projected here by someone. You’re here investigating through your shadow, not your physical body.

Fu Hua fell silent.

Even though she had made her fair share of analyses about the current situation, she hadn’t entertained that possibility before.

'''Fu Hua:''' Griseo, is this observation… due to your abilities?

'''Griseo:''' Yes. After all, the Hua in the cycle told me that the precondition of getting colored is to see the true colors of someone that even they can hardly perceive.

'''Fu Hua:''' She actually said the things I’ve wanted to say, but never had the chance to.

'''Fu Hua:''' However, if you can see this nature, then is there any color related to the Honkai on the Ark now?

Griseo shook her head.

'''Griseo:''' …As you know, the only thing closely related to Honkai energy on the Ark is the engine, which is now nowhere to be found.

'''Fu Hua:''' Then, what if we expand our range to the whole of Qiming, which is to say, to a planet that’s located somewhere in the real world?

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' If the Ark hadn’t taken a sharp turn of direction before it fell, we should have been on the edge of the solar system by now.

'''Fu Hua:''' …!

And so, to learn about the situation, the two activated the Troubleshooter again.

'''Griseo:''' Question: Where is the planet where the Ark is currently located?

'''Troubleshooter:''' The last recorded report after the Ark’s fall indicates that it fell about 4,500 astronomical units from the Sun, which is about 150 times the distance from Neptune to the Sun.

'''Troubleshooter:''' However, despite its extreme distance from the Sun, the planet is surprisingly abundant in light and water, as well as possessing two natural satellites with no signs of the Honkai; After the system’s comprehensive evaluation, it is suitable for cultivation.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' (Being so far away from the Sun, there should be no trace of light and heat here…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Wait. The Sun?)

'''Fu Hua:''' Griseo, the city representatives here have once shown me a scroll, claiming that it’s the myth about the origin of the world.

'''Fu Hua:''' Somewhere on the scroll, there was a strange shining spot which I considered unimportant at that time and regarded as some kind of special ore.

'''Fu Hua:''' As for sunshine, the most vital thing for the Earth…

'''Fu Hua:''' Before the discussion of the city representatives over whether I could be admitted to the museum was over, I had watched the sky carefully: there was no sun-like luminous object, only a boundless sheet of light.

'''Griseo:''' To think they could achieve so much while being at the edge of the solar system… Incredible.

'''Fu Hua:''' If it were just about the incredibility of natural phenomena, it might be explained by the Honkai energy. But there is one contradiction…

'''Fu Hua:''' Be it in the Myth of Creation or the gossip on the streets, there is the abstract concept of “solar” and “sun”.

'''Fu Hua:''' That suggests that the people who first passed on the concept had seen the real sun and understood the importance of it to civilisation.

'''Fu Hua:''' And if we relate that theory to the efforts of those behind the capture of the Ark, you being put to sleep, and the seed-sowing without permission…

'''Griseo:''' So, you’re saying that the person who passed on this concept and the person who did this to me and the Ark could be the same one?

'''Fu Hua:''' Right. Besides, although small, it does not completely rule out the possibility that this person could still be hidden in the Ark at this moment.

'''Griseo:''' …!

'''Griseo:''' Question: How many people are in the Ark right now?

'''Troubleshooter:''' Two. One being the pilot, the other Hua.

'''Griseo:''' Good…

'''Fu Hua:''' (So Yellow and Blue weren’t here at all.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (That is to say, although I accidentally found Griseo who has been missing for years, I was still nowhere near the root cause of the strange change on Qiming.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Worse still, I can’t make myself above suspicion because of Griseo’s theory of projection.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (After all, in terms of time, the change did not happen until after I came to Qiming. Perhaps Cyan and Orange have long suspected this, but they still decided to trust me…)

'''Fu Hua:''' *Sigh*...

…!!!

'''Griseo:''' Did you hear the noises outside?

'''Fu Hua:''' Let’s go check it out. I’m a little worried about them.

<span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,#d65252,#51c29e,#e78c40,#b9dd36,#8251c2); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Vitas:</span> …!

'''Fu Hua:''' How is this possible?

'''Fu Hua:''' Griseo, leave this place to me. You take the children to safety first.

'''Griseo:''' Okay. You be careful too, Hua.

'''Fu Hua:''' (...)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Griseo was right. Now I really exist as a projection.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (...But why isn’t this the case when I face other monsters?)

'''Fu Hua:''' Are you alright?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' We’re fine, Fu Hua.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Is this Miss Griseo, Fu Hua?

'''Fu Hua:''' Yeah. I found her in the Ark.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Then Blue and Yellow…

'''Griseo:''' Sorry, we have double-checked. There were only me and Hua… I mean, Fu Hua in the Ark.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Could they have been taken by the monster we encountered just now?

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' (Mmm…)

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Calm down, everyone. I have something more important to say!

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Oh yeah?

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Actually, Green and I lied to you before.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' We didn’t come out empty-handed from the museum. On the contrary, we obtained a lot of information beyond our wildest dreams.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' I am sorry that I didn’t tell you this before. Firstly, it was out of caution against outsiders. Secondly, we were concerned this matter would further disturb everyone’s already uneasy mood.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' But now, indecision and hesitation will only result in a more severe situation.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' You… Do you still remember that person in the display case?

'''Fu Hua:''' …!

'''???:''' As the story unfolded, it seemed that we were finally at the climax.

'''???:''' And our shrewd detective also remembered that ghost from the past lurking in the shadows.

'''???:''' Her eyes big like saucers, she muttered that name with evident surprise…

'''Moriarty:''' Just like…

'''Moriarty:''' Now.

===Act 2 - Drama of Past Vengeance===

====<u>Gameplay 41-7 - Ring of Sins</u>====
“I’m so sorry, my friend. The moment you receive this letter, it means that I have broken our promise and left without saying goodbye.”

“Please, follow the railroad towards the north in pursuit of that swindler named Willie Paul. In fact, there will be neither me nor Willie Paul at the station you are arriving at. Only this belated letter of explanation.”

“If nothing had happened, I would have landed in Belgium by now, a far cry from Glasgow where we were supposed to meet.”

“As for the next stop, I can’t say for sure now. It depends on how our real enemy will act. In the best case scenario, I will catch him in Antwerp, but as you know, it won’t be easy.”

“I’ll try to make amends to you when this is all over. Perhaps you’ll like some chocolate?”

“Of course, I know that a delicious specialty can’t compensate for a thrilling adventure. After all, it’s an essential material for your survival.”

…

At the simple wooden table, Fu Hua was writing silently and quickly with a pen that had just been filled with ink.

The light indoors was poor but good enough in this era where light bulbs were not yet popular.

It was the rough paper and poor-quality pen, rather than lighting, that affected her writing speed more. After all, she had decided to write the letter to Holmes in the spur of the moment, and she could only make use of what was at hand.

And, considering the clandestine nature of things, she didn’t want to leave traces of someone living in her room.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

“...Even so, I still hope you will understand my decision. We are only one step away from arresting our common enemy; but in this final step I must engage him in close combat.”

“As a Schicksal Valkyrie, I have no reason to put citizens in such danger; Even if you volunteered just to satisfy your curiosity.”

“Of course, this is not to negate the services you have done for us in the past; finding the crime scene first, giving Scotland Yard the runaround on my behalf, introducing me to the street children who call themselves the ‘Young Detectives Crew’...”

“I will submit all of the above to Schicksal in the form of a report. Certainly, it will also include your several acts of vandalising the scene, moving evidence, beating up police officers to resist arrest…”

“Rest assured, Schicksal will give you a fair judgment. Based on my experience, it won’t be too severe.”

“At the very least, they won’t go after those autobiographical literature works of yours. You can’t give away the most crucial secrets.”

“After all, M’s true identity… You don’t know anything about it.” Fu Hua hesitated a little, before adding those seemingly harsh words.

More than three months have passed since she came to England and began this special mission.

Whether it was the members of Schicksal who contacted her, the Scotland Yard police who were forced to cooperate, or even a certain someone who accidentally became her travel companion, they only knew one thing…

That she was sent here directly by the Schicksal Overseer to track down an exceedingly vicious criminal mastermind, James Moriarty.

This criminal mastermind never left any trace, but he secretly controlled the entire underground network of criminals in London. He was ruthless in his actions, yet there was a calm elegance revealed in the details of his actions. No one knew where he came from…

…Except for a very few. Like Fu Hua, or Otto Apocalypse, the Schicksal Overseer.

In fact, essentially, the latter could be regarded as Moriarty’s father.

Because, this Moriarty…

…Came from one of his Prototype Soulium Bodies.

How on earth did this Soulium body awaken his sense of self? And how did he escape from the backup warehouse of Schicksal and make it all the way to England? Why did he name himself Moriarty? How did he establish himself to be the head of criminal organisations in London?

On the other hand, how did Otto investigate all this? Why give her the task, and not Reanna, who is clearly more involved in this?

Fu Hua had no clue about any of the questions above, and never intended to delve into them. For hundreds of years, she and Otto had come to an understanding, or so she thought.

For her, there was only one thing that mattered at the moment: eradicating Moriarty’s criminal organisations once and for all and bringing him to justice.

Fu Hua thought back to all the cases during the last three months and summarised them on the paper.

“After the incident with Colonel Moran, we all thought that he was finally at the end of his rope. But strangely, he didn’t seem to be so demoralised… Instead, he appeared to be more and more motivated.”

“In Paddington, he disappeared from a surrounded carriage, leaving us with nothing but a defiant note; in Macelton, he used us to break up a rival gang that was trafficking children, while we never found a single trace of him.”

“I cite those examples to remind you that he was not only crafty, but also seemed to enjoy playing games with us. Even the destruction of the organisation he had built from scratch failed to spoil his enjoyment.”

“With such a volatile enemy, no one knows what he will do when cornered. So I had to carefully clip all his wings first, before going after him alone for the final pursuit.”

“After all, with all due respect, when it comes to fighting within Schicksal, you really can’t help me in any way.”

Stopping here, Fu Hua took out her pocket watch and carefully confirmed the time.

“...I’m positive that no one can get you to put aside your curiosity. That’s why I asked my colleagues in Schicksal to secretly distract you and make you think that Willie Paul is important too.”

“I’m staying in a hotel in a small town outside Dover. The hotel is so sparse, and it’s so remotely located that I even needed the local newsboy to deliver my letter. I’ll be out of here in less than seven hours.”

“I have no luggage, and I will leave no trace. It will be almost impossible for you or Moriarty to find me.”

“In a few days, it will all be settled. Go back to Baker Street and be patient until then; Schicksal will send someone to tell you the whole truth.”

'''Fu Hua:''' …

The moment she signed “Fu Hua”, even she herself did not expect that…

The legendary duel that was later to be interpreted beyond recognition had quietly started from that moment.

'''Fu Hua:''' …Gotta go send the letter.

Fu Hua returned to the front entrance of the hotel, handed the letter to the newsboy who had been waiting there for a long time, and gave him some hush money.

'''Fu Hua:''' (...I should go back to my room.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (I’ll catch the first ferry tomorrow morning and keep tracking Moriarty. As long as he hasn’t noticed me…)

Right as she walked down the corridor, lost in thought…

'''???:''' The lady there, the guest in Room 105, please wait.

'''???:''' If I am not mistaken… Are you Fu Hua from Schicksal?

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

A young man in uniform came out of the blue and strode toward Fu Hua.

'''Fu Hua:''' And you are?

'''???:''' I didn’t expect to see you here. Looks like there’s some truth in those Scotland Yard rumors. Have you heard what they’re saying? That there’s always a Valkyrie hailing from the Orient who consistently shows up just when there’s a case or a problem.

'''???:''' Heh… I’m joking. Don’t you remember me? We must have met before, when that arson attack happened last month.

'''Fu Hua:''' Excuse me, but I have met with too many people during the last few months.

'''???:''' Very well. How silly of me. You’re quite the famous figure after all… I’m Inspector Henry from Kent, and I often run errands for Scotland Yard too.

He pulled a police ID out of his pocket. His movements were slightly dramatic, and he seemed to have handcuffs and weapons stuffed in the pockets of his bulging plainclothes, which gave an unexpectedly unassuming impression.

'''Detective Henry:''' I’m here for a scoundrel named Willie Paul. You must have heard that name.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' (Willie Paul… Contrary to the false information I gave earlier, he did flee in this direction.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (But now even the police from Kent came all the way here. Could Moriarty also…)

'''Detective Henry:''' Ahem. Anyway, seems like that name indeed rings a bell. I have an eyewitness testimony that he escaped into this hotel a while ago. Have you seen him?

'''Fu Hua:''' Sorry. I know nothing about it. I just arrived here.

'''Detective Henry:''' Oh… What a pity. I thought I was really lucky today to meet the famous detective whom even the Chief of Police yields to, thinking it would save me a lot of effort in my investigation.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

From the man’s seemingly sarcastic tone, Fu Hua realised that this inspector belonged to the local police force that would not accept her easily.

Due to the strong intervention of Schicksal in the pursuit of Moriarty, many police officers found it hard to adapt to the existence of Valkyries like Fu Hua.

'''Fu Hua:''' (...Looks like I’ll have to spend some extra time explaining myself here.)

'''Fu Hua:''' I thought Willie had lost touch with Moriarty’s organisation; It’s only a matter of time before Scotland Yard arrests him.

'''Fu Hua:''' But I never thought he would wind up here. If it’s a mere coincidence…

'''Detective Henry:''' Maybe it’s a coincidence. Or maybe you misanalysed things. In any case, it’s my job to find out the truth.

'''Detective Henry:''' Now I’m going to search the entire floor. Fu Hua, if your usual confidential mission is not so urgent, would you mind giving me a hand?

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Detective Henry:''' In principle, it is the duty of the police to arrest fugitives and ensure the safety of civilians. Accordingly, we have the right to ask anyone to cooperate. I know I can’t possibly ask you of that, but…

'''Detective Henry:''' Cooperation with the police, at least in this country, is indeed a virtue.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' (Looks like this one is going to be a hard nut to crack.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Still, it’s more than seven hours before the morning ferry weighs anchor. Furthermore, I have to confirm whether Moriarty has somehow been able to track my whereabouts.)

'''Fu Hua:''' Fine, let’s be quick.

'''Detective Henry:''' I’m very honored.

'''Fu Hua:''' I should make it clear that regardless of how the case develops, I must continue with my mission tomorrow morning.

'''Detective Henry:''' Fine.

'''Detective Henry:''' Let’s split up from here. I’ll start on the left, could you please take the right?

'''Fu Hua:''' Alright. How much can I disclose to the guests?

'''Detective Henry:''' Ask them if they saw a man with blond hair this afternoon. That should be enough. With such bad weather out there, there shouldn’t be more than a few people around here.

'''Detective Henry:''' And of course… If you do see Willie, just punch him in the face and arrest him on the spot. You know what he looks like, yes?

'''Fu Hua:''' Of course.

…

'''Guest in Room 111:''' Who is it?

'''Fu Hua:''' Excuse me. Have you seen a young man with blond hair? During this afternoon in this hotel, I mean.

'''Guest in Room 111:''' I don’t think so… I don’t usually pay much attention to the others…

'''Guest in Room 111:''' Are you the manager here? What’s wrong?

'''Fu Hua:''' Just a few normal inquiries. Please don’t panic. If you notice a similar suspicious person later, please report it to the hotel front desk.

…

The door was unlocked, and there didn’t seem to be anyone inside.

Fu Hua checked the room quickly and found no sign of anyone breaking in.

…

The door was unlocked, and there didn’t seem to be anyone inside.

The furniture in the room was plain and nothing special, just like all the other rooms.

…

The door was unlocked, and there didn’t seem to be anyone inside.

There was even some dust on the carpet at the entrance, and the sign on the door was crooked. It seemed that not only was the hotel not doing well, but the manager wasn’t very diligent.

…

The door was unlocked, and there didn’t seem to be anyone inside the dark room.

The window of this room was not closed properly, and a breeze was blowing through it. Still no trace of the fugitive.

…

'''Guest in Room 106:''' Who’s there? What’s your deal?

'''Fu Hua:''' Excuse me. Have you seen a young man with blond hair?

'''Guest in Room 106:''' Who are you? Why should I answer that?

'''Fu Hua:''' I’m an associate to the police. That should be enough for you to understand.

'''Guest in Room 106:''' Police? Are you pulling my leg?

'''Guest in Room 106:''' C’mon! I only came all the way here thinking that it’d be quiet enough and that no one would disturb me…

'''Fu Hua:''' You just need to answer my question, and I’ll leave you alone. It won’t take long.

'''Guest in Room 106:''' …Of course. I don’t want any trouble. I was in my room all day today, and I didn’t see anyone matching your description.

'''Fu Hua:''' Okay. If you notice a similar suspicious person later, please report it to the hotel front desk.

'''Guest in Room 106:''' Alright, alright. What’s with my luck today…

'''Detective Henry:''' Looks like you’ve finished there. As expected of a Valkyrie, you certainly do things fast.

'''Fu Hua:''' Unfortunately, it amounted to nothing. No one saw anything.

'''Detective Henry:''' Same here. But there is still one last room.

'''Fu Hua:''' This is…

'''Fu Hua:''' Sorry, but that’s my room.

'''Detective Henry:''' That’s right. I realised that just now. But technically, I need to finish searching each and every room here.

As he spoke, he put his hand on the doorknob and pulled it down gently…

<nowiki>*</nowiki>rattle*

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Detective Henry:''' What is it?

'''Fu Hua:''' I don’t think that I locked the door when I left…

As soon as she said that, the expression on both their faces grew apprehensive.

'''Detective Henry:''' You’re sure?

'''Fu Hua:''' I am.

Fu Hua took out the key and inserted it into the lock, only to find that she couldn’t turn it even an inch.

'''Detective Henry:''' Locked from the inside. Looks like our friend chose the worst possible hideout.

The inspector grabbed the door handle hard and gave it a few tugs while he slammed at the door with his other hand. But there was no response from the room.

'''Detective Henry:''' I guess we’re not welcome.

The inspector took out the gun hidden in his pocket and seemed ready to break the door lock directly. But Fu Hua stopped him by blocking the door first.

'''Fu Hua:''' Let’s not panic anyone else. Leave it to me.

…

'''Fu Hua:''' There, it’s settled.

After Fu Hua applied some force with her wrist, the door shook a little before the handle on the side dropped limply.

'''Detective Henry:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Come on!

Without so much as an explanation, Fu Hua pushed open the door.

She thought there would be a malicious criminal behind the door, or at least a helpless goon.

Perhaps she could get information about Moriarty from this criminal and speed up her final pursuit; Or perhaps she would find that her whereabouts had been exposed, and Moriarty would once again disappear into the dark, nowhere to be found.

But the reality completely betrayed her imagination…

'''Fu Hua:''' What’s this?

A man lay on his stomach on the carpet of the room.

A young man with blond hair, exactly as described by the inspector, and the image in Fu Hua’s memory. This fugitive, who had worked for Moriarty, now lay lifeless in Fu Hua’s own room.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Detective Henry:''' This is… Can you explain the current situation to me, Fu Hua?

'''Fu Hua:''' …He’s dead.

'''Fu Hua:''' As for how, I need another minute to think.

'''Detective Henry:''' …

The inspector eyed Fu Hua strangely, and crouched down to check the man lying on the floor.

'''Detective Henry:''' Unquestionably, this is Willie Paul. And he is indeed dead.

'''Detective Henry:''' Well…

'''Detective Henry:''' I now need your cooperation more than ever, Fu Hua. If you can’t explain what happened in your room… Then undoubtedly, you are one of the suspects in this case.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

It seemed that the cunning criminal mastermind had prepared a real big gift for his sworn enemy this time.

'''Detective Henry:''' Let’s get this whole thing straight.

'''Detective Henry:''' Before I arrived, you left Room 105 for about five minutes to post a letter, right?

'''Detective Henry:''' Five minutes later, you returned to the hotel and met me. The two of us searched the other ten rooms together, and there was no sign of Willie.

'''Detective Henry:''' In the end, the only room left was yours. You found the door locked, and we broke in together… And then Willie’s body was discovered.

'''Fu Hua:''' True.

'''Detective Henry:''' So, in just a few minutes, a body just popped out of the floor of your room like a mushroom.

'''Fu Hua:''' Yes. I deem it unbelievable too.

'''Detective Henry:''' Need some advice?

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Detective Henry:''' I will report the facts to Scotland Yard. At the very least, while all this is going on… I have to advise you to not leave this room.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Haven’t I mentioned that I also have a very important investigation on my hands? If I don’t make it to the target’s next hideout tomorrow, the whole chain will break.

'''Detective Henry:''' …I’m in the same dilemma here. If I leave this dead body alone, the justice we endeavor to uphold will also break.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' In that case, let’s fulfill your sense of justice before the earliest ferry sets sail. What do you say?

'''Detective Henry:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' I’ll find out the truth and prove my innocence. Then, you can naturally allow me to leave.

'''Detective Henry:''' …

'''Detective Henry:''' Alright then. My body is not as tough as the door lock, so I’ll spare myself the pain. I’ll allow you to do things your own way.

'''Fu Hua:''' Thank you for your understanding, Inspector.

The inspector said no more and turned away. Apparently, he was indeed not used to this way of solving cases, and even appeared to be a little nervous.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Next…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Hopefully I won’t have to resort to using Fenghuang Down.)

The one on the floor was Willie Paul, as dead as a doornail.

'''Fu Hua:''' (There are signs all over his body that he was beaten… He seems to have been through some kind of torture.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Was he jailed somewhere to be interrogated?)

'''Fu Hua:''' (But it must take quite an effort for him to be covered in bruises like this.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (If he had just been killed, how could the killer have inflicted such severe injuries in such a short time? If he was already dead, how would the killer move the body into my room?)

The desk was a mess. Evidently, the fight between the victim and the murderer took place here.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Blank papers are scattered everywhere, and the spilled ink has already solidified.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (...They don’t seem to indicate anything.)

The hands on the clock pointed to the space between the numbers “9” and “10”.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Huh? Strange indeed… I had observed the clock before, and it worked perfectly.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Did the pendulum get hit? If so, maybe it can be used to reconstruct the time of the incident…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (No… In any case, it could only have happened during the short time I was gone…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (And, judging by the position of the body… The conflict at the time of the murder couldn’t have easily affected the clock…. So why did the clock slow down?)

The small table was strewn with paraphernalia: two train tickets, a ferry ticket, a few notes, and cash, a far cry from the lack of life in the room that Fu Hua tried to maintain.

'''Fu Hua:''' (From these clues, we can reconstruct his movements… As I had expected, he escaped London and headed east…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (However, Willie seemed to be receiving some kind of guidance on the run. Moriarty? Why would he do that for someone useless to him?)

'''Fu Hua:''' (And… why would he leave all the evidence in my room deliberately?)

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Detective Henry:''' Well, that was fast. Found anything, Fu Hua?

'''Fu Hua:''' I need another moment to put the clues together.

'''Detective Henry:''' Hurry, please. My colleagues are probably on their way here.

'''Fu Hua:''' Understood. However, I would also like you to provide information about the other people in the hotel, including the guests and the manager.

'''Detective Henry:''' …

'''Detective Henry:''' You may be disappointed, as there aren’t many people in this hotel to begin with.

'''Detective Henry:''' Three guests plus one manager. That’s all.

'''Detective Henry:''' Aside from you in Room 105, there’s the gentleman in Room 106, and the old man in Room 111… None of you have seen Willie, so he probably entered through the back door or the window.

'''Detective Henry:''' Anyway, the manager at the front desk knew nothing useful. She said it was her first day filling in for the owner, her uncle, who had an accident while horseback riding.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Detective Henry:''' The gentleman in Room 106 is a painter, or so he claims. In order to find a quiet place to paint, he chose this remote hotel under the recommendation of a friend. There’s nothing unusual in his record.

'''Detective Henry:''' According to him, he did hear some muffled noises coming from the next room about a few hours ago. You can confront him about that testimony… But I don’t feel like he was talking nonsense.

'''Fu Hua:''' (A few hours ago… At that time, I was the only one in the room, so that can’t be true. Unless…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (...No, no need to force the lie detector on him now. Let me try to solve the problem his way, something I learned recently.)

'''Detective Henry:''' As for the old man in Room 111, he’s a little confusing. I heard that he wanted to stay in the room closest to the staircase. He’s here for an appointment he missed in his youth… Sounds like something a dotard would do.

'''Detective Henry:''' The old man said that he had been keeping an ear on the movement in the corridor, but could not be sure when Willie Paul had arrived. He relies on his ears more as his eyesight is rather bad.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Detective Henry:''' The last one would be you, Fu Hua. The manager said she didn’t remember you checking in at all, but claimed you did stay here… It’s rather strange, isn’t it?

'''Fu Hua:''' (...It can’t be helped. She does look unreliable.)

'''Detective Henry:''' Plus, the old gentleman in Room 111 remembered the sound of your boots, and the young man in Room 106 testified that there was a weird noise in your room… Honestly, my imagination is running wild right now.

'''Fu Hua:''' …I get what you’re hinting at.

'''Fu Hua:''' But don’t you worry… If I had my way, you wouldn’t even remember meeting me by now.

'''Detective Henry:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' Don’t mind it. Anyway, before your colleagues arrive, I will get to the truth.

'''Fu Hua:''' Just like all those cases my partner and I have cracked during the last few months.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

…

'''Fu Hua:''' Think harder. The main questions remaining are…

<tabber>
|-|[CHOICE] - The body that suddenly showed up=
'''Fu Hua:''' (Within five minutes of my leaving, Willie’s body suddenly appeared in the room. Also, he had injuries that would take a long time to cause.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Generally, even a Valkyrie would have had a hard time killing someone in such short notice and bringing the body in.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Or… Could it be that the whole thing had happened over a longer period of time? Maybe Willie’s body had been there for a while…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (...But how could it have fooled me?)
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
|-|[CHOICE] - The locked door=
'''Fu Hua:''' (Before breaking in, the door was locked and could not be opened with a key. That means the door was locked from the inside.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (But there wasn’t anyone alive in that room. So, how did the door end up locked from the inside…?)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Besides… Why would the person who did all this lock the door? How would that have helped them?)
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
|-|[CHOICE] - The other guests=
'''Fu Hua:''' (There are 11 rooms in total. In addition to Room 105, Room 106 and Room 111 are also occupied. They can give testimony about the staircase and the next door to the scene respectively.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (It’s all such a coincidence… But what it suggests…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Wait a minute. I remember when I knocked on those two men’s doors to investigate… The order was…)
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
</tabber>

<tabber>
|-|[CHOICE] - The conclusion is…=
<div style="line-height: 15px></div><br>
</tabber>

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' (If that’s the case… It was a misjudgment on my part to not cheat just now.)

'''Fu Hua:''' This is Room 105.

'''Fu Hua:''' 106…

'''Fu Hua:''' 107…

'''Fu Hua:''' 108…

'''Detective Henry:''' Hey, Fu Hua, what’s the matter?

'''Fu Hua:''' And then from here… 1, 2, 3, 4…

'''Fu Hua:''' So that’s how it is. It’s all clear to me now.

'''Fu Hua:''' A trick like this… Simple but effective.

Inspector Henry caught up to her, panting like a dog.

'''Detective Henry:''' For a second, I thought you would run away.

'''Fu Hua:''' …Heh.

'''Fu Hua:''' Where to begin… Not long ago, we found the body of the fugitive Willie Paul in Room 105. As a guest in Room 105, I’m a natural suspect.

'''Fu Hua:''' But what if… Even from your point of view, I shouldn’t be suspected of anything?

'''Detective Henry:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' I am the one living in the room, and the victim was found there… What if it’s not the truth? I can prove it from at least three angles.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

<tabber>
|-|[CHOICE] - The notes on the table=
'''Fu Hua:''' On the table at the scene, I found Willie’s ferry tickets, notes, cash, and other random things.

'''Detective Henry:''' …Well, since Willie was there in the first place, it’s not a big deal for him to leave some things behind, is it?

'''Fu Hua:''' I beg to differ. This is because the table was empty before I left the room. If Willie had snuck into my room when I wasn’t there, then he had no reason to leave so many of his things there.

'''Fu Hua:''' Unless, he didn’t think it was someone else’s room.

'''Fu Hua:''' …
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
|-|[CHOICE] - The malfunctioning clock=
'''Fu Hua:''' I had paid the clock in my room some attention before, and it was accurate. But there was something wrong with the time on the clock in the room where the body was found.

'''Fu Hua:''' Ruling out accidental collisions… It was obvious that the clock did not keep good time to begin with. That’s to say, they are not the same clock.

'''Fu Hua:''' …
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
|-|[CHOICE] - The solidified ink=
'''Fu Hua:''' Until I left the room, I was writing a letter at my desk using the ink on the desk. I can even find the newsboy to vouch for me.

'''Fu Hua:''' But now, that bottle of ink had been toppled over, and the splashed ink had solidified.

'''Fu Hua:''' Who can make an entire bottle of ink solidify in just a few minutes? The answer can only be that they are not the same bottles of ink.

'''Fu Hua:''' …
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
</tabber>

<tabber>
|-|[CHOICE] - Overall, I think…=
<div style="line-height: 15px></div><br>
</tabber>

'''Fu Hua:''' Put all the above together and the answer can’t be more obvious.

'''Fu Hua:''' The room where we found the body wasn’t actually Room 105, the room I’m staying in. To be precise, it’s Room 107, which is symmetrical with mine.

'''Detective Henry:''' …

The inspector made a sharp inhale, unable to question Fu Hua, and simply stared at her absent mindedly.

'''Fu Hua:''' It’s easy. The hotel corridor is originally a circle, where simply reinserting the paper door plates in reverse order was enough to mislead me, who is basically a stranger here.

'''Fu Hua:''' As a result, Room 105, the fifth room on the left, became Room 107, while Room 107 became Room 105.

'''Detective Henry:''' …So you’re saying you walked into the wrong room just because someone switched the room numbers? What if you happened to go the right way? Besides, didn’t you check Room 107, too? Wasn’t that supposed to be your room, based on your own account?

'''Fu Hua:''' Sure, it sounds a little weird. But that’s because I have other commitments right now and didn’t want to leave any traces in my room.

'''Fu Hua:''' …In other words, it was a deception tailor-made for me, who was used to covert operations. And the killer did something else…

'''Fu Hua:''' He first misled me to the entrance of the corridor, and then asked me to count back from 11. Counting numbers backward made me lose my awareness of the original room numbers.

'''Fu Hua:''' Both rooms 105 and 107 are located deep within the building; considering that it was late at night, when people were less attentive to details, the chances of a mix-up were significantly high.

'''Fu Hua:''' Finally, the murderer himself stood at the door of Room 107 and told me, as a police officer, that it was Room 105, which completed the last step for the misdirection.

'''Detective Henry:''' You…

'''Fu Hua:''' …I’m sorry, inspector. You’re the one who switched room numbers while I was out posting the letter. In this way, you lured me to Room 107, where the body really was.

'''Fu Hua:''' As for the other guests, Room 106 is located in the center of axial symmetry and would not change even if the door number is switched; Room 111 and Room 101 are very close, and the old man with poor eyesight only cared if his room was next to the stairs.

'''Fu Hua:''' If an investigation happens later, both the unreliable manager and me, who’s not legally accountable, would be far more suspicious than you. By misleading us, you could avoid any social repercussions.

'''Detective Henry:''' No… That’s not true, Fu Hua. You can’t suspect me without rhyme or reason…

'''Fu Hua:''' There is a reason, and I have a way to prove it.

'''Detective Henry:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' One of the things that really puzzles me about this whole thing is why you locked the door to the fake room. But combined with what you were doing, I understand now.

'''Fu Hua:''' If it had not been locked, I’d have found that the key didn’t fit, and known the room had been switched. So you needed to lock the door and give yourself a reason to break in.

'''Fu Hua:''' Your real goal was to break the lock so I wouldn’t know it was actually the original Room 107. In other words, Room 107 now is my original room, the one right in front of us.

'''Fu Hua:''' Therefore, if the key in my hand happens to be able to lock this door…

Finishing her words, Fu Hua turned around and inserted the key into the key hole.

However, before she heard the distinct click of locking…

'''Detective Henry:''' …I surrender.

…The outcome was already clear.

…

After that, the policemen who received the urgent telegram took Inspector Henry away.

According to him, he followed Willie in hot pursuit and finally, with the intel from the informant, found his target in the hotel.

Eager for promotion, he interrogated Willie by force to find the whereabouts of his accomplices, but accidentally killed him as a result.

After that, he happened to see the Schicksal Valkyrie come to the same hotel, and them came up with a whole series of tricks…

Apparently, he was not a law-abiding detective to begin with. The illegal use of firearms is prohibited by the British police, but he tried to break the lock by firing a gun.

'''Fu Hua:''' (He thought naively that in order to accomplish my mission, I would not care about the life of a man like Willie and would simply choose to bury it.)

But she cared.

'''Fu Hua:''' (However… Saying that he came up with the whole plan himself… That’s definitely a lie. By cheating, I confirmed this theory.)

Inspector Henry had definitely crossed paths with Moriarty, and perhaps the whole thing had been orchestrated by the latter. Maybe he just accidentally killed someone, and Moriarty swooped in.

But it makes no difference. Every detail of this strategy that would only work under a particular combination of circumstances was a part of Moriarty’s plan.

The owner of the hotel who fell off the horse, the guests who were tricked for various reasons, the fraudster who chose to hide here, the police who got the information from an informant, and even the fact that the deceased easily died from the forced confession itself… How much of it was actually orchestrated?

And could it be that the whole point of this was to delay Fu Hua and distract her from pursuing Moriarty? Or was he simply playing a game?

'''Fu Hua:''' …

A shiver ran down Fu Hua’s spine at that thought. That was his style, but…

'''Fu Hua:''' (...Wait.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (If Moriarty had planned it all, he had to know that I was staying here and my itinerary, as well as the way I was staying…)

'''Fu Hua:''' Could he have seen the letter I wrote? Impossible, since I just had it delivered before I met the inspector. Do I have to assume that Moriarty had been following me all this way?

In that instant, Fu Hua thought she saw Moriarty’s silhouette as clear as day.

'''Fu Hua:''' That newsboy… He knew I was here, waiting by the door for me to finish the letter… Only he had the time and conditions to come up with this ruse, and to throw it as a lifeline to the inspector who had accidentally killed someone.

'''Fu Hua:''' Wait… That’s to say, that child is actually Moriarty? Seriously?

No, on second thought, that isn’t strange at all. A body of Soulium had great plasticity in nature… Therefore, changing the appearance to be a child wouldn’t be impossible for him.

After all, nearly no one had ever seen Moriarty’s real appearance, and taking the form of a child served as a natural disguise to mislead Fu Hua and Otto.

And this body was even more convenient than adults’... He could escape through a hole in a surrounded carriage, or he could pose as a victim and infiltrate the child trafficking organisations to give orders…

'''Fu Hua:''' (...Yes. This must be the truth.)

Too late to contact the real detective now. This time, Fu Hua was positive that she had finally reached Moriarty.

Should she tell the local police to track the newsboy immediately? But with his ability…

'''Fu Hua:''' Wait.

'''Fu Hua:''' I remember the postcard he had in his hand when I met him… If that’s the next address he’s going to… If he’s provoking me with that…

'''Fu Hua:''' The Reichenbach Falls…

--

====<u>Gameplay 41-8 - Point of Departure</u>====
Time flew by.

More than a hundred years have passed since that famous showdown, which has long been celebrated in the annals of world detective literature.

And the two people who were the original models for the protagonist and antagonist have long since parted ways, in the truest sense of the term.

When they meet again, will they remember the incident on the night before the showdown?

Or could it be, from the perspective of this cunning revenge-seeker, what’s in sight now is the very real vendetta… or just a straightforward goal, like it’s a game?

Coming back to the present, the avenger who claimed to be an artist looked from a distance as his “old friend” was surrounded by monsters. He even made pretentious comments from time to time.

This was his favorite way of doing things. He didn’t show up before the other party, and hid in the shadows where he had the best seat to admire the show he had intricately planned.

'''Moriarty:''' …Oh, it’s really nice to see you’re doing well, my dear detective.

'''Moriarty:''' You are determined, confident, and tenacious. Once you have your eyes set on the target, you will get there no matter what. Just like every pioneer that people have admired throughout the ages.

'''Moriarty:''' In my opinion, this is your greatest strength. It deserves the highest praise. You know, I’m not afraid to acknowledge my opponent’s advantages.

'''Moriarty:''' After all, with sufficient research, a person’s greatest strength is more often than not also his Achilles’ Heel. Like most fish, they can hardly drown indeed, yet they can never live without water.

'''Moriarty:''' One hundred years ago, after a pursuit across several countries, we finally met at Reichenbach.

'''Moriarty:''' And now, you have also followed the traces I left and helped me open the forbidden area.

'''Moriarty:''' That one-track mind of yours has really done me a huge favor.

'''Moriarty:''' So, how about we wait and see what happens next?

'''Moriarty:''' Out of etiquette, I prepared a grand reunion party for our beloved detective.

'''Moriarty:''' Let’s see… who will be the one being pushed down the falls this time.

…

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Griseo, tell me the truth, how are you feeling?

'''Griseo:''' I haven’t recovered… much of my combat abilities, but if necessary, I will do my best.

'''Fu Hua:''' No, don’t push yourself. Protect the Vitas and help me find those monsters’ weaknesses. This type of monster is very special, they could affect my stability as a holo-projection, so don’t underestimate them.

'''Fu Hua:''' And, they didn’t do anything this time. Someone might be giving them orders from the shadows.

<span style="color:#516dc2;">'''???:'''</span> An accurate judgment. You must be the rumored Fu Hua. As they say, you are reliable in all aspects… No wonder the other Vitas trust you so much.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' You are…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Yellow! Blue!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' How did you get caught? Are you alright?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Hang in there, I’m gonna get you out!

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Ah…

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Calm down, Red. Take a good look.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' They’re not being held hostage. The monsters are working for them.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' What are you talking about, Green?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' We’ve been partners for, like, forever, and this is the first time I’ve ever heard about these uggos.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Besides, weren’t they just attacking us? They’re totally the bad guys! No way they’re working for Yellow and Blue.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' I’m unsure as to how they obtained this power, but if…

Disciplined Vita paused, the words she was about to utter sticking in her throat.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' If Yellow and Blue were behind everything the whole time…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …?

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' It would explain how Blue managed to put up those barriers that halted the Honkai beasts… Isn’t that right, Purple?

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' I… I don’t know…

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' You mean Yellow and Blue orchestrated this entire disaster? It seems too outlandish to believe, but somehow my gut says Green might be right…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Your instincts never fail you, Purple. I’ll remind myself not to steal your pudding next time.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' You’re right. Yellow and I have indeed been helping Moriarty in secret. That said, we’ve also tried to minimise the damage incurred against Phosphorus.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Sorry guys, but we’ve been on Moriarty’s payroll for a while now.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' How…

Yellow’s confession confirmed the terrible truth.

'''Fu Hua:''' Can I ask a question?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' By all means.

'''Fu Hua:''' Why did you, as city representatives, choose to help Moriarty?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Yeah! What’s your reason for going to the dark side?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

Mindful Vita paused a second, trying to find the right words to formulate an appropriately thoughtful answer.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' I find the phrasing of your question rather interesting, Fu Hua. You very much emphasised our role as city representatives.

'''Fu Hua:''' I don’t suppose that’s changed as well, has it?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' If that’s what you wish to know, then I can assure you it has not.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Right here at this moment, neither Yellow nor I have forgotten our role as representatives, nor our corresponding duties.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Much like any other Vita, we share a deep concern for the welfare of Phosphorus, and are deeply grateful for your continued assistance in protecting its citizens.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' But Moriarty is putting everyone in danger, and you’re helping him!

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Your words are incorrect.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' I admit that everything that is happening at present does appear to be linked with Moriarty. But if viewed from a more fundamental perspective, he could hardly be considered the true culprit.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Yellow and I decided to side with him because doing so will bring tangible benefits for Phosphorus’ future.

'''Fu Hua:''' Did you strike up some kind of deal with him?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Correct. He has promised me crucial answers regarding the truth of this world and the calamities that are befalling it.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' And you’re going to take everything he says at face value? You can’t be serious.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' What if he doesn’t hold up his end of the bargain?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' There is, admittedly, a considerable risk. But we did not decide to help Moriarty on the foundation of an empty promise.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' A better way to put it would be that we simply had no choice. This was our only option. After all, nobody knows how much time we have left.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Time? What are you talking about?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I’m not sure I follow.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' I understand if you’re perplexed by the abruptness of these developments, but Green and Purple do not seem as taken aback.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Huh?

The Vitas looked towards Purple and Green.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' You have also spoken with Moriarty, have you not?

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' That’s right.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' I’m sorry we didn’t tell you straight away. Purple and I went to the museum before coming here and met with Moriarty.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Having heard what he said, I understand what Blue’s getting at…. A little bit. I can somewhat comprehend why he chose to help Moriarty.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Green, you…

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' But…

'''Moriarty:''' The ruins of Hesperus, or Changgeng, as your friend would call it, left a deep impression on me when I first visited them.

'''Moriarty:''' The gullies and ruins were arranged in a way that seemed so familiar, yet also went completely beyond my comprehension.

'''Moriarty:''' The golden ratio… the most aesthetically pleasing ratio in all of the cosmos, could so aptly exceed space-time to grace a faraway frontier… If not for the lack of writing paper here, I’d have written down these details immediately.

'''Moriarty:''' Really, I’m joking. I’ve no intention of manipulating your invention, though it does seem you don’t know much.

'''Moriarty:''' How can that be? Don’t you see the intricate arrangement we’ve been presented with? Phosphorus, Hesperus, and the remoter ruins.

'''Moriarty:''' These arrangements are ordered in a very regular way, just like a conch shell. Much in the spirit of your precious disciplines, Disciplined Vita.

'''Moriarty:''' If all these came from a certain deity, what would their purpose be? What is the meaning of all these artificial arrangements? Your history, your laws, even these cryptic calamities…

'''Moriarty:''' As city representatives, don’t you want to know the answers to these questions? Isn’t it your duty to figure them out?

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Moriarty pointed out our flaws, and maybe he’s right… we don’t know our city well enough to fulfill our obligations as city representatives.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Maybe he can bring us the true answers and real change.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' But despite everything…

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' I still think that all we’ve accomplished up to this point has its own intrinsic value.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' We have ensured a peaceful life for the citizens by upholding the rule of law.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' And it is for that very same reason that our city has become as prosperous as it has.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Orange’s candy-tasting festival, Cyan’s photo album, and Purple’s celebrations… All of these are the results of our efforts, carried out according to our own rules.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' That’s why I choose to believe in the regulations that have brought us this far. Finishing tasks on time, patrolling on schedule, festivals in every season… These habits have created a host of wonderful memories.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' In comparison, Moriarty is a no-good brigand who has committed terrible sins in the past. All that he’s brought here are Honkai beasts and hellish turmoil!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' It doesn’t matter what supposed truth he’s peddling or how tempting his so-called visions are, I will never trust him!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Nor should either of you! Yellow, Blue, you’ve got to snap out of it!

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Green…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Yeah, Green is right!

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' I’m not a big thinker like Green, but my gut tells me Moriarty is gonna betray us!

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' I believe in Green and in myself!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' We turned him down back at the museum. As for you two, it’s not too late to do the same.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Especially you, Yellow. Blue roped you into this, isn’t that right?

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' I don’t know why he’d trust Moriarty, given his intellect… But I’m sure you can see Moriarty for who he really is.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I…

Surprisingly, Veracious Vita shook her head.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' It’s not true, Green. It was I who decided to follow Moriarty first.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …!

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Why, Yellow?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' …

The other Vitas bombarded Yellow with a series of questions, but she said nothing in reply, her only response being her increasingly drooping head.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Don’t force her to explain herself.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' You have a point, Green. But I’m fulfilling my responsibilities as a city representative in my own way.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' I don’t expect you to understand, but I hope you won’t overreact. I think it’s fairly obvious that reaching a mutual agreement is out of the question, so I propose that we go our separate ways.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Farewell, for now. Next time we meet, I might bring some of Purple’s puddings as a peace offering.

Mindful Vita took Veracious Vita by the hand, after which the two of them turned around and walked past the monsters.

'''Fu Hua:''' Wait, Mindful Vita!

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' Believe me when I say this: Moriarty is an expert at mind games. I know him well from our run-ins in the past.

'''Fu Hua:''' I have no right to interfere with your decision, but I implore you… You must be extraordinarily cautious and decisive when dealing with Moriarty. Never falter or let your guard down for a second.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' I will. Thank you, Fu Hua.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Hey, wait!

'''Griseo:''' Calm down, Red. The monsters are still here.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' But…!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Don’t be selfish, Red. Now’s not the time for recklessness.

'''Fu Hua:''' Griseo, Green, take the others and go. I’ll deal with the monsters.

'''Griseo:''' Are you sure you can handle them alone?

'''Fu Hua:''' Nothing I haven’t done before. Besides…

'''Fu Hua:''' It’s pretty obvious we’re still pulling a few punches with each other, at least for the time being.

'''Fu Hua:''' (I knew it…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Every time I run into this enemy… my body becomes unstable.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (For the long run, I need to find a countermeasure.)

'''Fu Hua:''' Solved. I need to get back to them.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Fu Hua!

'''Griseo:''' Are you alright?

'''Fu Hua:''' Yeah, but these monsters just keep spawning. I don’t know how long I can hold out. If only I could find out why I’m a projection…

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Let’s get back to the city ASAP. They’re sitting ducks over there.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Okay…

'''Fu Hua:''' What’s the matter, Green? Something on your mind?

Green frowned as if trying hard to make up her mind. She walked up to Fu Hua and proclaimed in a solemn tone.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Fu Hua… we would like to apologise to you on behalf of Yellow and Blue.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' We are very grateful to you for protecting us and Phosphorus, or Qiming, as you’d call it, from the Honkai beasts.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' I was hesitant about whether to let you in at the beginning, but it turns out you’ve made the greatest contributions of all of us. The troubles came from inside of our own team…

'''Fu Hua:''' It was their choice, and I’m sure they had their reasons for doing so. You needn't feel guilty about it.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Of course. We have complete faith in Yellow and Blue. If they’re still calling themselves city representatives, they won’t do anything that goes against their duty.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Th-Thank you, Fu Hua.

These words of gratitude, gravid with solemn sincerity, were all the more powerful having come from the ordinarily aloof Green.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I agree that Yellow and Blue wouldn’t attack the city, but I can’t say the same about Moriarty.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' And these monsters he has under control… Aren’t they a bit different from Honkai beasts?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Really? I thought they were just a different variant of Honkai beast.

'''Fu Hua:''' No, Cyan is right, I’ve never seen Honkai beasts like that before. They felt… abnormal. I’m curious how Moriarty managed to tame them.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' They appeared when you were in the forbidden area. No one knew where they came from.

'''Fu Hua:''' Can you see anything, Griseo?

'''Griseo:''' Nothing useful, I’m afraid.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Griseo:''' I can see some strange colors inside their bodies, but I can’t put a name to any of them.

'''Griseo:''' Without a proper name to give them, it’s difficult to even describe them properly, let alone determine what they represent.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Is it like when you read a foreign language? You don’t have a clue as to what it means, but you can at least tell it’s a cohesive language.

'''Griseo:''' Yeah, sort of.

'''Griseo:''' I’ve had similar experiences on other planets. Over time, I think I may start to understand the colors and figure out what they mean.

'''Fu Hua:''' I see.

'''Fu Hua:''' (But how did Moriarty obtain all this power? Taming monsters, becoming privy to all these secrets, befriending city representatives… What’s his trick?)

While Fu Hua and Griseo were racking their brains over Moriarty’s ability, the small Vitas were discussing among themselves beside them.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Hey, don’t you think Great Detective Fu Hua has been acting strange since she returned from the forbidden area?

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' What do you mean?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' She still hasn’t told us what happened there.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' That’s because there’s so much going on. After we get ourselves out of this situation, I’d love to hear how she saved Griseo.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Maybe. But I have the feeling she’s keeping something from us.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Hey, say something, Purple. You have the best instincts, so use them and see if I’m right.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Purple? Purple!

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Ah! Sorry, I spaced out for a second.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' You’ve been out of it ever since Yellow and Blue left.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Are you worried about them?

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Yeah…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Relax. Luck has always been on Yellow’s side. And she has Blue with her, who is a total brainiac.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' As for Blue… Well, you know him. He’s a bit of an oddball, but he knows what he’s doing.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Ah… Right!

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' What?

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' I’ve been having this strange feeling from the very beginning. Why would Blue specifically choose to talk to me in such a critical moment? It’s hardly his style.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' You mean the thing he said about stealing your pudding?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Pudding… It sounds familiar. Haven’t we heard that word before?

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Miss Vita! It’s that cold, silky-smooth dessert she brought back from her travels!

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' I kept the rest in a festival warehouse, but we haven’t had any festivals lately, so no one’s been in there for a while.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' So by telling us he stole the pudding, was Blue actually saying that he had visited the warehouse?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Could he be trying to tell us where Moriarty was hiding? Or some other kind of secret?

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' That does sound like classic Blue.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Counting on Purple to pick up on a hidden message with her superior instincts… Yeah, that’s him, alright.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Then let’s go to the warehouse and catch this dastardly Moriarty!

The small Vitas immediately told Fu Hua their discovery.

'''Fu Hua:''' Yeah, it’s definitely worth us paying a visit to the warehouse, but…

'''Griseo:''' I need to analyse these colors in the new monsters so that we can be better prepared should we have to go up against them.

Griseo explained her analytical powers to the Vitas.

'''Griseo:''' Specifically, I need to first become familiar with the world, this city, and everything here. Only by understanding the colors of the world can I have a chance of interpreting the beings born in it.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Uh… I’m not entirely sure what that means, but I think you’re saying you wanna explore the city, right?

'''Griseo:''' Right.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Then you’ve come to the right people. Nobody knows the city better than its representatives!

'''Fu Hua:''' In that case, let’s split up.

'''Fu Hua:''' I’ll investigate the warehouse while the rest of you go with Griseo. You can take her on patrol and keep order in the city while helping her get a better understanding of the so-called colors of Qiming.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Hey, wait! Are you gonna go there by yourself? We’re potentially talking about the bad guy’s main lair here.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' No way you’re going in there alone. It’s way too exciting… I mean, dangerous.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Yeah. Besides, you’ll need someone to guide the way. Relying on a map isn’t very practical.

'''Fu Hua:''' That’s true.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Orange, Cyan, you’ve accompanied Fu Hua in the past, so why don’t you go with her this time as well?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Wait, it should be me! I’m the fastest Vita, always leading the way!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' (That’s precisely why you’re the least suitable for the job…)

Green and Orange exchanged a knowing glance.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' We are well aware of your enthusiasm, Red. That’s why we’re entrusting you with the most important task of all.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' You are? What is it?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Think about it. Moriarty’s strength lies in the monsters that he controls. By finding their weakness, you’ll be making a huge contribution towards defeating him.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' But…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' You just said it yourself: No one knows the city better than you. You’re practically made for the job.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Oh… yeah, I guess that makes sense. Alright, leave it to me!

Righteous Vita grabbed Griseo’s hand, ready to hit the road.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Let’s hurry get started, Griseo.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' I’m gonna show you everything! The festival galas, the Trouble Resolution Center, all of it!

'''Griseo:''' …Okay.

'''Griseo:''' (But…)

It’s hard to say how much help learning about Qiming’s history will do for Griseo tapping into her powers.

It is abundantly clear that the monsters have little to do with the city’s history. Their origin, essence, and potential weakness seem rather detached from the city itself.

'''Griseo:''' (Still…)

'''Griseo:''' (This is Qiming, and it has developed its own colors.)

'''Griseo:''' (While this was never my intention, it has become an outcome of Project ARK, the continuation of our kindling.)

'''Griseo:''' (With that being the case, it is my obligation to understand, record, and protect the colors here.)

'''Griseo:''' (Actually, no. It has nothing to do with obligation or responsibility.)

'''Griseo:''' (All colors and beings in this world are intricately interconnected.)

“At the tail end of a carpenter’s yard is a warmly lit house. Inside, the inhabitants are making coffee.”

“A flock of white doves fly over the red-tiled roof as black smoke rises from the chimney. A large green lawn spreads out on the ground, neatly trimmed, while the gray sky above exudes a sense of tranquility and serenity.”

“It is early morning, so life has still not yet fully awakened from the previous night’s slumber. Soaring birds, rising chimney smoke, small figures roaming from afar… these are the elements that comprise my painting, and I hope you like them.”

'''Fu Hua:''' Do you think Griseo will be alright?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' No need to worry. So long as she’s got the reliable Green and the perky Red with her, nothing bad will happen. She’s even got Purple, who has incredible instincts, around her.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' I’d wager Purple is the second-most skilled of all the Vitas when it comes to dealing with tough predicaments.

'''Fu Hua:''' The second? Then who’s the first?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' That goes without saying… ta-da!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Orange? What are you…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' I’m trying to pay you a compliment, dummy.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Erh… I…

Fu Hua let out a sigh of relief as she saw the two Vitas return to their usual playful selves.

Between new monsters appearing out of nowhere, a reawakened criminal mastermind, and the betrayal of two close friends, these seemingly wide-eyed city representatives must be under an inconceivable amount of pressure.

It was for this reason that Fu Hua decided not to reveal her findings in the forbidden area.

The connection between the Ark and the Vitas’ creation myth, the Sprout in the museum, and Griseo’s captor… She needed to connected the dots somehow.

'''Fu Hua:''' (What are you planning, Moriarty?)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Have you gone to all this trouble just to get back at me?)

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Over here, Fu Hua. This is Purple’s warehouse.

'''Fu Hua:''' Looks like it’s been neglected for quite some time.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Well, since it’s a warehouse, we chose somewhere quiet. You don’t want a lot of traffic around your storage space.

'''Fu Hua:''' That’s not what I meant. I thought you had lots of festivals and stuff, so why aren’t you using this place more often?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Well, we do have a bevy of festivals every year, but that doesn’t mean there’s something going on every single day.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

The reply sounded oddly vague, but the frequency of festivals was the least of her worries at the moment.

'''Fu Hua:''' Anyway, keep some distance while I lead the way. We don’t know where Moriarty is, and for all we know, he could be lurking in the warehouse.

…

'''Fu Hua:''' …!

The door opened from the inside before Fu Hua could make a move. A figure leaped out of the building…

No, not one, but three figures!

'''???:''' Boss? Are you back?

'''???:''' You are! Oh, how I missed you!

'''???:''' Pete, take another look, why don’t ya! That ain’t the Boss!

'''???:''' Our superiors have yellow and blue collars. These two here are Orange and Cyan.

'''???:''' And who’s that girl in the middle? They may dress alike, but Boss is a guy, not a girl.

'''???:''' Didn’t I tell you to look closely before opening the door?

'''???:''' Blame Pete! He kept complaining about the warehouse being so dark and scary, and he said he couldn’t wait to meet the Boss!

'''???:''' You’re the one who just ran in front of me, Fred!

'''???:''' No, I didn’t!

'''Fu Hua:''' …

Three children appeared out of nowhere and promptly began to bicker with one another, leaving Fu Hua at a loss.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Fred, Pete, Ella? What are you doing here?

'''Fred:''' Orange? Wait… er, I mean stranger! This is our base! You’re not authorised to enter!

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Base?

'''Fred:''' Yeah, this is the base of the Young Villains Crew. The only people who can stay here are those who have gotten the Boss’ permission.

'''Fred:''' No one else is allowed to interfere… Hey, what are you doing, Ella?

'''Ella:''' Chill out, Fred. Villains or not, we can’t be rude to the Vitas.

'''Fred:''' Why not? It’s our duty as villains to fight the Vitas who run the city!

'''Ella:''' That’s what lowly minions would do. Supervillains should befriend the heroes and infiltrate their ranks from the inside! Like what Blue and Yellow are doing.

'''Fred:''' Wow, really? You’re more conniving than I thought, Ella.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Alright, time for some explanations. What are you all doing here?

'''Ella:''' Fine, you caught us. Like Fred said, this is our Boss’ secret base. We’re keeping it safe when he’s away.

'''Fred:''' I’m the top dog around these parts. I joined the day before yesterday, way earlier than Pete and Ella.

'''Peter:''' I… I’m the second-in-command here. Fred dragged me here.

'''Fred:''' Ella was the third to join, and then Yellow and Blue came after her. The two of them outrank me because of their abilities, but that’s no big deal! I’ll beat them one day!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' You call yourselves villains, eh? Have you done anything evil?

'''Fred:''' You bet! We’ve committed all sorts of heinous acts with the Boss.

'''Ella:''' Hey!

'''Fred:''' Oh, right! I’m not supposed to tell you that. If the Vitas caught wind of it, they’d tell our parents…

'''Fred:''' Anyway, unless you’ve got permission from the Boss, you’re not taking one step past this door.

'''Fu Hua:''' Can I ask you something about your boss? Is he called… Moriarty?

'''Fred:''' Huh? How did you know that? No one else in Phosphorus has ever laid eyes on him!

'''Fred:''' Wait, lemme think… I don’t believe I’ve ever seen you either… And your outfit…

'''Fred:''' Oh, I get it. Are you the Boss’ sister? What should I call you?

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' (Moriarty is recruiting kids from our city?)

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' (He must be using his innocuous looks to his advantage. The first time I saw him, he didn’t strike me as a supervillain either.)

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' (He’s clever, I’ll give him that.)

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Hey, you three, pulling pranks is one thing, but working for Moriarty?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' There’s nothing cool about pretending to be a villain. Forget about the harm you may cause to the city, you may end up getting yourself into real danger.

'''Peter:''' But Boss has never asked us to do anything dangerous. He even gives us all sorts of delicious food!

'''Fred:''' That’s because you’re not his right-hand man! Boss has said that only vital members like Yellow and Blue are able to participate in high-profile missions.

'''Peter:''' You’re awfully low on the totem pole yourself, Fred.

'''Fred:''' Ugh…

'''Ella:''' No need to worry, Orange. We’ve never done anything dangerous. Just some basic legwork.

'''Ella:''' When all hell broke loose this morning, he even told us to stay at the base.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Did Moriarty say that?

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Whatever he’s up to, we’ve got to get into this base and figure out his plan.

'''Fu Hua:''' Do you really intend to prevent us from doing that?

'''Fred:''' We’re not letting you through! Boss said that if anyone tries to force their way in, we’re to call him immediately.

'''Fred:''' Even if you are his sister, without orders from the Boss, we still can’t… Ouch! What are you doing, Ella?

'''Ella:''' Have you forgotten about Blue’s order?

'''Ella:''' “Under special circumstances, an informant may also be regarded as a member and granted access to the base, provided that they bring the tokens.” I believe these were his words.

'''Peter:''' Oh yeah, I do remember that.

'''Fred:''' But this bunch hardly looks like informants.

'''Ella:''' …

'''Fred:''' Oh! Stop hitting me! I get the point. We’ll give them a chance, okay?

'''Fu Hua:''' (“Provided that they bring the tokens”?)

'''Ella:''' The most valuable of all treasures, the most precious of all knowledge, and the most cherished of all gifts. Show us the three tokens, and we shall grant you access to the base.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

Fu Hua took out her pocket watch to check the time. It had been 15 minutes since they split up with Griseo.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Let’s try reasoning with them first. If that doesn’t work, we can always force our way in.)

'''Peter:''' Let’s see, which one is my token again… Oh, right, the most valuable of all treasures.

'''Peter:''' If you can show that to me, then I’ll let you in.

'''Fu Hua:''' The most valuable treasure…

'''Fu Hua:''' I’m not familiar with the customs here. What kind of items do you consider valuable?

'''Peter:''' I dunno, something shiny? I’ve never really seen any treasure myself.

'''Fu Hua:''' Something shiny…

Fu Hua reached into her pocket. She recalled how she rummaged through the destroyed cabin at the beginning of her journey in the Ark.

Apart from several gifts from old friends, all that search had turned up were some metal fragments of the broken cabin.

At the time, she wasn’t sure why she had felt compelled to place the fragments in her pocket. Perhaps she had wanted a keepsake before continuing with her investigation. Or had she been reminded of the meteor shard in the museum and intended to confirm if there was any connections?

At any rate, this fragment was indeed part of the meteor which had played a role in creating this world.

The only problem was that it looked no different from an ordinary metal shard, making it a far cry from what one would traditionally consider treasure.

'''Peter:''' Ah, yes! That’s it! You’ve passed!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Huh? That? But it’s only a…

'''Peter:''' Trust me, that’ll do just fine.

Pete put the fragment in his pocket and stepped aside.

'''Peter:''' You know, I don’t really want to play villains. I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for Fred.

'''Peter:''' I know you’re the good guys, so I’ll let you in. This way, I can be an undercover agent amongst the villains!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Undercover agent…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' You’ve got a variety of roles in this little game you’re all playing.

'''Fu Hua:''' That’s very kind of you. Thanks, Pete.

'''Ella:''' The token I’m responsible for is called “the most precious of all knowledge”. Hand it to me, and I’ll let you in.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Knowledge… What kind of knowledge? Like a book?

'''Ella:''' No, that won’t do. Blue has read virtually every book in the city. You’ve got to come up with something way cooler than that to get past me.

'''Ella:''' Like first-hand info about Hesperus, videos of the forbidden area…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' The forbidden area? How do you know about that?

'''Ella:''' How else? Blue told us. He wants some photos of that area so much. He told us himself.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Then I have just the ticket.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …?

Erudite Vita calmly opened his camera, unspooled the film, and handed it to Ella.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' This instant film captured everything we saw around the forbidden area today. I believe it’s worthy of the name “the most precious of all knowledge”.

'''Ella:''' Wow…

'''Fu Hua:''' Hey, Cyan, isn’t that your favorite type of film?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' It sure is! You’re willing to give it away, just like that?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Every roll of film means the world to me, and that’s precisely the reason why it fits the criteria.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' The most important thing that a film roll holds isn’t knowledge, but memories. With Orange and Fu Hua by my side, I’ve made so many timeless memories along the way.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' If it means that we can continue on our adventure together, then one roll of film is a price I’m willing to pay. At least, that’s what I think.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Oh, Cyan…

'''Ella:''' Alright, I’ll take it!

'''Fred:''' Now, the most cherished of all gifts. And I’m no softie like them. You’re not getting past me unless it’s something REALLY special.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' What a precious gift… but I don’t have the habit of giving gifts.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Speaking of gifts, isn’t that Orange…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I mean, Orange’s…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' What are you trying to say?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Orange’s favorite… You understand what I’m getting at, don’t you, Fu Hua?

'''Fu Hua:''' Oh, you mean that thing Orange has always kept with her?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' What are you two talking about? Oh!

Encompassing Vita blushed as she realised what they meant.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Ah, so that’s what you’re talking about… Actually, I’m not into candy that much…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' But then again, I suppose it could be true…

'''Fred:''' Hey, what are you whispering about? Whatever it is, hand it over!

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Here.

'''Fred:''' …?

'''Fred:''' …

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' What? Aren’t you gonna eat them?

'''Fred:''' Do I look like a baby to you? This is just a handful of candy. How’s this supposed to be the most cherished of all gifts?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' If you don’t want them, then I’ll just take them back.

Encompassing Vita tried to pull her hand back, but before she was able to do so, Fred had already snatched the candies.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …

'''Fred:''' …

'''Fred:''' I guess these’ll do after all. Who’d have thought the Encompassing Vita’s most cherished gift was a bunch of candy? Haha!

'''Fred:''' If word of this got out… Oh, no!

'''Ella:''' Alright, you already have your precious gift. Step aside.

'''Fred:''' Whose side are you on?

Fred walked away to enjoy the candy, grumbling to himself.

'''Fu Hua:''' I take it this means we can access your base now?

'''Ella:''' Sure. We may be villains, but we keep our word. Isn’t that right, you guys?

'''Peter:''' Absolutely.

'''Fred:''' Yeah…

'''Ella:''' Come on in.

'''Fu Hua:''' Aren’t you coming with us?

'''Ella:''' Nah, we’ve got to keep a lookout. We’ll send you a message if Boss returns.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Hmm? But didn’t you say earlier that Blue would grant access to the base if we presented the tokens?

'''Ella:''' Yep, but Blue also said that should any informants enter the base, we should try and keep it a secret from Moriarty. Oh, and to keep an eye on the Print of Hope.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Is Blue…

'''Fu Hua:''' Let’s just head in first.

'''Fu Hua:''' So this is Moriarty’s base.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' It doesn’t look much different from the last time we were here.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I think I see a few things that weren’t here before.

'''Fu Hua:''' Let’s give this place a once-over, before Moriarty comes back.

'''Fu Hua:''' What’s this?

Some pieces of paper were scattered on the ground. The kids must have gotten bored and knocked a notebook off one of the tables while horsing around.

The handwriting somehow seemed both foreign and familiar.

It appeared strange because despite their many clashes, Fu Hua was still unable to discern her enemy’s real handwriting, as it had been carefully masked with various forensic countermeasures.

The familiar English-style font and flow, however, transported her back to that remote age…

'''Fu Hua:''' What’s this?

<tabber>
|-|Someone’s Notebook #1=
Six hours have passed. Unlike when I first left that transparent coffin, I’m now familiar with this brand-new body and able to command it. To be honest, it did come with many convenient abilities, leaving me amazed at how the times have changed.

Nevertheless, out of my habit, I found some ink to pen my precious thoughts. A virtual body made of data… even if it is invulnerable to swords and guns, it is still much too fragile in my eyes. The only things that can reassure me are those immortal… above data, written proofs; above proofs, unfading arts.

I retook the second step, and now it is time to take the third.

Where should I start? My Soulium body of the past was utterly destroyed by a certain self-righteous quack detective (yes, by her fists) at that moment. This brings me to the questions: who preserved the me of that moment and exhibited me as a museum piece in this unknown land; what was the turn of events that freed this inanimate but thoughtful display overnight?

For the latter, I have a superficial guess. The guy who added me to his collection might have lost his right to imprison me due to a hiccup such as a tripped breaker. As for the answer to the former… I need more patience to go on a quest.
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
</tabber>

'''Fu Hua:''' So it is Moriarty’s diary…

<tabber>
|-|Someone’s Notebook #2=
The second “day” after I was awakened has come. The quotation marks are necessary, because at one moment too marvelous for words, I made some astronomical discoveries. For a few seconds, I wondered how someone else who made the same discoveries would’ve reacted. Would they have been ecstatic over a major scientific discovery, or would they have wailed at the grim exile imposed on them? But it matters not, I was at peace with the discovery… if the other me who survived a fall down the waterfall was observing this place, he would’ve been rather bored.

The body that exists in the form of data, or projection, has provided me with a great deal of convenience, and therefore I’d like to apologise for my earlier belittlement of it. I wandered through the city with great ease, familiarising myself with its organisational structure, technological development, and cultural traditions. I still know little about its history, but that’s not my problem. When an unsolvable puzzle comes into my view, the first thing I consider is whether the puzzle itself is wrong. “The history of this world”, in my opinion, is one such.

I will put the historical puzzle aside for a moment to look at the geographical puzzle. Of course, these two often go hand in hand. After a thorough survey, there is only one area that I have yet to venture into. The people here seem to call it the “forbidden area”. Could the answer I’m looking for lie within it? Since there is still one cog missing from the machine, I have no reason to let it go. It was only when the infiltration plan was put into action that I realised one crucial point: the forbidden area is not a gimmick for fooling the ignorant masses.
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
</tabber>

<tabber>
|-|Someone’s Notebook #3=
As far as the physical results are concerned… yes, my body cannot enter the forbidden area.

At first, I thought this stemmed from the limitations of the data body, so I conducted a series of experiments. First inorganic matters, then organisms, insects, small animals, and finally three juvenile residents willing to run errands for me… The results were disappointing. By taking a cursory exhaustive approach, I proved that the forbidden ground was indeed impregnable.

No, that’s not right. It cannot be described as exhaustive unless I have tried that unique option…

I took a great risk and appeared before two city representatives. One of them was the most virtuous of character, and the other was the most sophisticated of mind. In other words, they both expressed their greatest weaknesses overtly.

They finally agreed to cooperate with me moderately, but did not take my side. But no matter, I believe this issue will be solved by time. As a sign of good faith, I promised Veracious Vita to pacify the animals that I had startled. With the help of Mindful Vita, we created a small toy that could generate projections to guide those animals that had fled their habitat back home; of course, this small toy simultaneously proved that the mechanical constructs here are also unable to break into the forbidden area.

This is all too boring; I mean it, it’s forcing me to do silly cute things like a real child. However, when I consider the fact that this will greatly lower those two’s guard against me, and allow me to steal some useful knowledge in the process… I begin to find it worthwhile.

But I must concede that, when they ultimately proved to me that even city representatives weren’t authorised to enter the forbidden area either, I felt quite depressed. For a moment, I felt like I was a clown in the world.
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
</tabber>

<tabber>
|-|Someone’s Notebook #4=
What happened this “day” was thrilling. I felt my body… though it has long ceased to exist… embraced by an unprecedented sensation. For this reason, I’ve gone out of my way to write in my diary before this long “day” is over. Yes, I’m certain that this “day” will be incredibly long.

At this moment, what pains me the most is that I must write down the changes that occurred today chronologically. This is the bottom line, otherwise my writing will lack basic logic, which is a fault I’d never want to see in the future.

Two things happened in all. The first was that marvelous cataclysm. Of course, I knew a little more about it than the city representatives. After all, I do possess knowledge of the Honkai. And as a result, those two Vitas believed that I could help them and find a way to end the cataclysm. They’ve actually thrown themselves at my feet.

As for the second thing, it was wonderful, horrible, and truly unforgettable. When I saw that face again, what was the first thought that came to my mind? Surprise, naturally, no one would’ve thought that I’d meet a fellow countryperson on this distant planet; Fear, justifiably so, knowing that my predecessor, the former vessel of this spirit, was, by her hand… No, there was another emotion that far surpassed them both. Yes, it was joy. A joy based on reason.

For the last few “days”, my exploration of this new world has always been hindered by problems concerning the forbidden area. By trial and error, I can almost prove that the forbidden area is a space that cannot be stepped into. When I was at an impasse, however, a variable presented herself to me. She was brand-new, pure, extraordinarily powerful, and I know her inside out. If I lead her to the forbidden area and use her to open that tempting door for me… I will make discoveries and gains like never before.

Yes, this is enough. As for the rest of my personal feelings, I can leave them aside for now. Now, to facilitate this fascinating plan, I will head over to the audience seats tailored for me, and enjoy this one-sided, long-awaited reunion…

Fu Hua took some time to piece together the diary and read through it carefully.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' What’s up? Did you find anything?

'''Fu Hua:''' Quite a lot, actually. First of all, we can use these writings made from Moriarty’s own point of view to confirm his real identity.

'''Fu Hua:''' He might not be the same Moriarty who confronted me at Reichenbach Falls and fell off the cliff.

'''Fu Hua:''' The most likely explanation is that someone made a mental and physical copy of him before his death, which enables him to exist as a projection.

'''Fu Hua:''' This means that his existence is more in line with my own, the only difference being that I can enter the forbidden area while he cannot.

'''Fu Hua:''' (But why?)

'''Fu Hua:''' (The one who backed up his consciousness into the museum, the elder sister of the Vitas… who is she?)

'''Fu Hua:''' (...)

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' It’s nothing. One more thing. The Moriarty we’re now up against has been trying to enter the forbidden area. That’s the reason why he recruited the kids and manipulated Yellow and Blue.

'''Fu Hua:''' But, what’s his motive? What has he discovered about this world? There’s no record about any of that here.

'''Fu Hua:''' Based on this diary, Moriarty isn’t seeking revenge. Instead, he has a greater agenda and is using the monster attacks to distract us from it.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Could it be…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Hmm? What are you thinking, Cyan?

Erudite Vita pulled the other two aside and pointed at a slip of paper on the table.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' When you were reading the diary, I searched the room and found this.

'''Fu Hua:''' Is that a map?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Is that the Print of Hope that Blue warned us about?

The paper Cyan found contained symbols indicating various architectural structures; the overall layout bore a clear resemblance to Qiming’s neighborhoods. Someone had marked out several regions with blue circles.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' These areas…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' If my memory serves me correctly, this should be a route map we used for a celebration once.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Oh, you’re right! How did you remember this stuff, Cyan? You’re incredible!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' It’s nothing, really… I just happened to remember, that’s all.

'''Fu Hua:''' But what is Moriarty doing with one of these maps?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I’m not sure. But he seems to be controlling the city from nearly every aspect: the history, the culture, and even us city representatives. I’m beginning to fear…

Erudite Vita nervously gulped before uttering his concerns with some trepidation.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Could he…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Be trying to rule this entire world?

--

====<u>Gameplay 41-10 - Solo Drama</u>====
…

'''Moriarty:''' …?

…

'''Moriarty:''' Alright, alright, I know. Keep working on it until you get this thing open. I hardly expected you to tear it down straight away.

'''Moriarty:''' Alas, what a solitary fate it is to partner oneself with beasts who can’t even speak the human tongue.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' If that bothers you so much, why don’t you talk with us more?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Yeah! You’re more than welcome to chat with us if you’re feeling lonely.

'''Moriarty:''' Chat? Hahaha… I thank you for the kind gesture.

'''Moriarty:''' However, beasts can coexist peacefully in packs because they lack a human’s intellect and cunning, whereas I find it difficult to trust two brilliant representatives such as yourselves.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' What’s the matter, Moriarty? Why don’t you trust us? We haven’t gone behind your back or anything.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' No need to worry, Yellow. He’s just being theatrical, as always. He has nothing against us, not really.

'''Moriarty:''' If I may, I would entreat you to show a little understanding for a poor soul in exile. Please allow me the slightest indulgence of my nature, which has been suppressed for so long.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Well, if you put it that way… I guess it’s fine by me.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Now, let’s talk business. We’ve done what you asked.

'''Moriarty:''' Have you? I certainly don’t see any trace of the great detective or her old friend.

'''Moriarty:''' I seem to recall asking you to bring them to me. Ah, unless you’re hiding them somewhere for a birthday surprise?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' We did try to get them for you, but your beasts weren’t as fast as you promised.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Besides, you never gave us full control.

'''Moriarty:''' That’s quite right, you clever little monkey. This brings me back to my days as a criminal mastermind. You see, my second-in-command was always scheming to get more power and usurp my position.

'''Moriarty:''' Not to fret, my friends, I’m quite certain you gave it your best. After all, you were against the great detective… albeit a projection, as you’ve affirmed.

'''Moriarty:''' There’s no need to feel ashamed that we were unable to catch her this time, nor does it imply any deficiency in our beasts.

'''Moriarty:''' In fact, I have every faith in their potential. After all, they’re part of the laws of nature.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' The laws of nature?

'''Moriarty:''' Ah, yes. I suppose you may not be aware of this. Ancient philosophers from my world regard the cosmos as being comprised of the basic elements of water, fire, earth, and air.

'''Moriarty:''' A drop of water, a tendril of flame, a handful of dirt, a wisp of air… They may seem insignificant on their own, but you just can’t eliminate all of them.

'''Moriarty:''' You cannot eliminate any constituent element, for in doing so, you would be taking on the cosmos in its entirety.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

'''Moriarty:''' The monsters appeared when the great detective entered the forbidden area today. There was no sign of human machinations, nor any effect from your laws.

'''Moriarty:''' This signifies that those monsters are a kind of failsafe from whoever composed the basic principles governing the cosmos. One could even safely assume that they derive from the same source as the power which had held me captive all those years.

'''Moriarty:''' Thanks to you, we have extracted the core of this failsafe from the ruins and tamed the monsters, thereby bringing us one step closer to the truth that we’re all so interested in.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Maybe. When we finally unveil the truth though, I’d appreciate it if you kept it short and sweet.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I’m not sure I follow. You’re saying that these are tough monsters, right?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' If that’s true, why do you have them banging around in front of the forbidden area?

'''Moriarty:''' No reason in particular. I’m merely curious as to whether they could tear off the door keeping us out.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' …?

'''Moriarty:''' The great detective uncovered some rather unexpected findings from her little venture there, but I’ve yet to see them with my own eyes.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …Are you jealous of her?

Moriarty shook his head without answering.

'''Moriarty:''' Unfortunately, the entrance here is tightly sealed. But I’ve found that the beasts, like the detective, remain unaffected.

'''Moriarty:''' What we can do, however, is send them to explore the forbidden area for us and bring back any findings they uncover.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' I suppose you’ve already found something?

'''Moriarty:''' That I have. The forbidden area, or the Ark, as it used to be called, constitutes a self-sufficient ecosystem. We simply have to repair it.

'''Moriarty:''' This way, it will become an ideal hideaway, hundreds of times more advanced than that temporary base in the city.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' I can’t tell if you’re being serious or not.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' You went through all this rigmarole just to find yourself some version of home sweet home?

'''Moriarty:''' In part. I shall rebuild my criminal empire in Hesperus, opposite to Phosphorus. Anyone who swears loyalty to me, including you and the three little brats, will be allowed to enter my domain.

'''Moriarty:''' All except for the great detective, that is. As for her, I might just kick her off a bridge, haha!

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Is this really what you want?

'''Moriarty:''' …?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I wonder, if all you really want is just a place to stay… then after you establish Hesperus, would you be able to get along well with us, and with the residents of Phosphorus?

'''Moriarty:''' …

A long moment passed before Moriarty said anything. It was the first time in the entire day that he had fallen silent.

'''Moriarty:''' I find your question most intriguing, Veracious Vita.

'''Moriarty:''' Before answering, I too have a question to ask.

'''Moriarty:''' How did it come to pass that you were the first Vita who decided to follow a villain such as myself?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Me? Let me think…

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Well, first of all, you promised to unveil the truth about this world and prevent the imminent calamity that is upon us.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Seeing our beloved city descend into turmoil is the last thing a city representative like myself would want to see. If I can uncover the truth and prevent this catastrophe by taking orders from you, then I’ll do so gladly.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Besides, it’s not like you’ve done anything really bad yet.

'''Moriarty:''' …

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' We’re all aware that you have nothing to do with the Honkai beasts, and you didn’t mean to harm Fu Hua.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' You’ve been kind not only to Blue and me, but to Fred and Pete as well.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Sometimes I wonder about how terribly lonely it must have been for you to be locked up in that display case for so long. Maybe that isolation would make you want to cherish your subordinates so much after getting out.

'''Moriarty:''' …

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Anyway, I don’t mind following you because you technically haven’t done anything wrong.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' And last but not least…

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Blue also says that it’s okay to follow you.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I’m not as smart as him, but I trust that his ideas are always right.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' So if Blue says it’s okay, then I have no problem with it.

'''Moriarty:''' …

'''Moriarty:''' I see…

'''Moriarty:''' Thank you, Veracious Vita.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

'''Moriarty:''' I thank your honesty and your trust for me. In my opinion, you deserve a reward.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' …?

'''Moriarty:''' Yes, in return, I’ve decided to…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …!

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' …!

…

'''Moriarty:''' Execute the next step in the plan in advance.

Mindful Vita widened his eyes.

Everything happened in a split second. It must have been the first time in his life that Blue acted impulsively.

There was no time for any kind of premeditation. Acting on gut instinct, he yelled out:

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Yellow!

He took one step forward, but the surrounding beasts quickly closed in.

Minutes ago, they had been heeding his orders, but now they were radiating a palpable and savage hostility.

'''Moriarty:''' I’d advise caution, Blue. I have their core now. Besides, if anything should happen to you, who would be in charge?

'''Moriarty:''' You need to calm down. Calm down, then think, think, think like crazy, like you always do… Hmm?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' You…

Moriarty’s smug tone made Mindful Vita want to disobey, but what he said made sense.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' When did you make up your mind?

'''Moriarty:''' What do you mean? Whether to abandon you or to attack her?

'''Moriarty:''' Not that it would make a difference. After all, you’ve never believed in my childish aspirations.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

'''Moriarty:''' The lonely Moriarty wants to rebuild his empire of crime, you say? Only simple-minded children would fall for that, or in this case, Veracious Vita.

'''Moriarty:''' But even that would be enough.

A sinking feeling began to form in the pit of Mindful Vita’s stomach.

'''Moriarty:''' Don’t look at me like that. We’re not so different, you and I.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …?

'''Moriarty:''' What? Don’t you agree? Did you really think I wasn’t aware that you leaked that information to the great detective?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …!

'''Moriarty:''' No matter. I played along, whether you were aware of it or not. I stood to gain quite a lot by allowing you to trick me. Thanks to you, I now know exactly where she is.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Are you going to set up an ambush on the base?

'''Moriarty:''' Isn’t that obvious? Thinking, thinking, always all this thinking… The only thing that ever comes out of it is treachery.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Tell me what you really want.

'''Moriarty:''' …?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' You’ve had the core, and thus control over the beasts, all along. You’ve had plenty of opportunities to tear us to shreds. There’s no need to have us return before striking.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Besides, you could have taken us all out in one fell swoop. Why are you attacking Yellow in front of me?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Yellow is your hostage, a bargaining chip to gain leverage over me. You want to make me so desperate so that I’ll give you something you need, something you can’t obtain through brute force alone.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' How am I doing so far?

'''Moriarty:''' …

'''Moriarty:''' Do you really want to know the answer, Mindful Vita?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …?

'''Moriarty:''' I suppose it won’t hurt to tell you, though this entire conversation is quickly becoming an exercise in tedious repetition.

'''Moriarty:''' The only reason why this is happening is that…

'''Moriarty:''' You have miscalculated.

…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' What do you mean?

'''Moriarty:''' You said that I’ve always controlled the monsters and needn’t strike now… but what if I’m simply waiting for you to let down your guard?

'''Moriarty:''' You seem to believe I have no need to attack Yellow in front of you. But what if that’s precisely what I’ve wanted to do all along?

'''Moriarty:''' That talk with Veracious Vita about my future plans must have put you at ease. You thought I was deceiving her, and that I was going to all this trouble because I still needed her.

'''Moriarty:''' You’ve been protecting her all this time. You know better than she does of the danger in cooperating with me, so you’ve tried to keep her in a safer position than yourself. Tell me if I’m wrong.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

'''Moriarty:''' Unfortunately for you, you’ve misjudged the situation.

'''Moriarty:''' I didn’t trick her because I needed her, nor am I keeping you to make use of you. In fact, none of this has anything to do with your supposed value.

'''Moriarty:''' It’s good to be calculating, Mindful Vita. It is a shame that a utopia like Phosphorus affords you so few opportunities to familiarise yourself with true villains. You’ve missed out on countless possibilities that would seem unfathomable to you.

Moriarty took one step closer as the beasts raised their weapons.

'''Moriarty:''' A real villain does not rely much on calculated premeditation. Generally speaking, the sword is in fact mightier than the pen.

'''Moriarty:''' As for the reason why I’m doing this to you…

'''Moriarty:''' It’s because I want to.

…

'''Moriarty:''' Hmph. I never was a fan of awkward silences.

'''Moriarty:''' Looks like it’s just me and them now.

Moriarty glanced at his slaves surrounding him. There was not the slightest trace of disappointment in his expression, but neither was there any joy.

'''Moriarty:''' No matter. It won’t last long.

'''Moriarty:''' They’ll wake up again in the future. They’re obliged to.

'''Moriarty:''' Much like what <span style="color:#e13838;">you</span> have always been doing.

'''Moriarty:''' I do wonder what kind of mind and veracity <span style="color:#e13838;">you</span>’ll encounter, next time <span style="color:#e13838;">you</span> return.

'''Moriarty:''' Not that it would make any difference for <span style="color:#e13838;">you</span>. After all, now that I’ve obtained a city representative’s clearance and the means to activate the forbidden area…

'''Moriarty:''' Half of this world has already fallen under my control.

'''Moriarty:''' Enough dawdling. Time for the next act in our tragedy to unfold.

Under the criminal mastermind’s order, the mysterious beasts launched yet another attack on the city.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Griseo! Run forward, this way!

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Ahead are the roadblocks Green and I set up, so it’s safe!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Shoot, it’s Konkai beasts! They shouldn’t be here!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Are they the ones that escaped this morning?

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Huh? They seem to be infighting?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Let’s go now!

The team of four found a temporary safe zone and listened to the howls of the Honkai beasts die down from afar.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Phew, that was close. We almost didn’t make it back there.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Did you see how those monsters started fighting each other at the end? Aren’t they supposed to be on the same side?

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' I wouldn’t say that.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' …?

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Some of them are Honkai beasts that only appeared this morning. According to Fu Hua, they have nothing to do with the forbidden area, and chances are, not with Moriarty either.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' The others, on the other hand, are being controlled by Blue, Yellow, and Moriarty. They were never on the same side.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Are you saying that Moriarty’s monsters are fighting the Honkai beasts for us?

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Now that I think about it, they never damaged any houses or attacked any residents…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Hey, this is Moriarty we’re talking about! The big bad! He’d never fight the Honkai beasts for us!

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' …

'''Griseo:''' “Moriarty is an expert at mind games.”

'''Griseo:''' That’s what Fu Hua said to me, and I believe her. Whatever Moriarty does, I’ll never trust him.

'''Griseo:''' I’ve never looked at him closely, but something tells me that his colors will be rather unpleasant.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Yeah! Listen to Griseo!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Whatever the case, we must remain alert. Do not approach Moriarty’s beasts, however harmless they may appear.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' And we’d better finish repairing the roadblocks to keep them from flooding the city.

Disciplined Vita explained to Griseo how they used to set up roadblocks.

'''Griseo:''' In that case, I’ll go retrieve the materials from the warehouse.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Huh? Why don’t you send me?

'''Griseo:''' Because I’m better at dealing with monsters.

'''Griseo:''' I’m not just a friend of Fu Hua. I used to fight alongside her.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …

Griseo’s sudden burst of determination left everyone speechless, even the typically loquacious Red.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' But Griseo, you don’t know how to get there or how to retrieve smart bricks. You don’t even have the clearance to open the warehouse. You’re going to need a Vita escorting you.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' I’ll go. Green is good at planning, and Red does everything swiftly. You two should survey the terrain and get ready to set up the roadblocks. Leave the legwork to me.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Then it’s decided.

'''Griseo:''' Let’s go, Purple.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' You got it.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Phew… we made it in one piece.

'''Griseo:''' Yeah, not a scratch on us.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Thank you for leading the way, Griseo.

'''Griseo:''' Wait, I thought you were the guide.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Oh yeah, that’s right… hehe.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' But all I really did was slow you down. This is a bit embarrassing…

'''Griseo:''' That’s alright, you’ve volunteered for the most dangerous task of all. Let’s fetch the smart bricks for them.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Sure thing!

'''Griseo:''' I wonder if these are enough…

'''Griseo:''' …Hmm?

As they removed the bricks, Griseo thought she saw something revealed on the ground.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' What’s the matter, Griseo?

'''Griseo:''' The ground…

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' What about it? Actually, I did have an odd feeling about this place when we entered…

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' But I don’t see anything.

Harmonious Vita bowed down, eyes squinting. She was nearly kissing the floor.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Oh, I see some scratches.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' What’s the meaning of them, Griseo?

'''Griseo:''' These are no ordinary scratches. There are traces of color to them.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' …?

'''Griseo:''' Remember what I said earlier about my ability to see colors?

'''Griseo:''' I wasn’t just talking about ordinary colors. Vestigial auras left by abnormal objects, the hidden nature behind unfathomable mysteries… I can decipher all of them in the form of colors.

'''Griseo:''' But it would be distracting being bombarded with these colors all the time.

'''Griseo:''' So I learned how to differentiate between them long ago. I only observe the colors which are necessary, according to my needs.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Necessary colors…

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Are you saying…

'''Griseo:''' Yes, I’m pursuing Moriarty and his monsters. And now, relevant colors have appeared on these scratches. This at least indicates…

'''Griseo:''' That those monsters were here at the warehouse and could have left these scratches when they were trying to move something.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' But we never saw any of them.

'''Griseo:''' Which means this could be a trap. See? They knew they’d leave incriminating auras or colors, so they covered it with smart bricks.

A sinister vibe loomed over the silent warehouse.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' So that’s why I had a bad feeling about this place… Have we walked into a trap?

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' (Now that I’ve regained some of my strength, I should be able to fend off the monsters. But I must protect Purple and return with the materials.)

'''Griseo:''' Don’t panic.

'''Griseo:''' Just remain calm and listen to me. We have to find a way out of here, quickly and quietly.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' But if the monsters have been waiting for us, all the exits must be blocked.

'''Griseo:''' Don’t worry about that. Come with me. Let’s not forget that I can see their colors.

'''Griseo:''' This way… No, the color is too thick.

'''Griseo:''' Purple, come back immediately.

'''Griseo:''' …

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' I think this is a dead end.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Have they blocked all the exits?

'''Griseo:''' No. Calm down, Purple.

'''Griseo:''' If Moriarty is aware of my power, he might be using that to confuse us.

'''Griseo:''' Let’s wait and give the colors a moment to settle. The shades will reveal where our enemies are hiding.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Then we’ll be able to escape?

'''Griseo:''' Not only escape. If we know where they’ve set up the ambush, we can strike back without them even knowing.

Griseo started exploring the room as she consoled Purple.

'''Griseo:''' This is the only room untarnished by the monsters. If we can find out why…

Her gaze swept over every inch of the room. The colors of metals, dust, plastic film, light, disinfectant, wind, water drops frozen on pipes, and radio waves swirled before her.

Suddenly, she found a seemingly insignificant patch of color hidden in a corner.

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' It’s a color I’ve never seen in Qiming…. But I should’ve seen it somewhere…

'''Griseo:''' …!

Griseo knelt down carefully and brushed away the dust gathered in the corner, revealing the fragment of a pattern. It all made sense to her now.

A fragment was all it took to make the memory come rushing back. That pattern…

'''Griseo:''' My drawing…

'''Griseo:''' But I thought I scribbled on the walls of the Ark…

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' Could this be…

A sudden attack of drowsiness was the answer to her question.

'''Griseo:''' Oh no…

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Griseo? Are you okay?

…

'''Griseo:''' This is… technology from the Ark… How?

'''???:''' Of course, it’s because I copied everything.

'''???:''' You can’t blame me. To go against a special existence like you, I can only take special measures.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' You! Moriarty!

…

'''Moriarty:''' Let’s put it this way, your technology is truly advanced beyond measure. Even I cannot replicate such a mysterious hibernation tech within a day.

'''Moriarty:''' So, I can only use what’s available.

…

'''Moriarty:''' Keep your eyes peeled and watch… Although you can barely open your eyes now.

'''Moriarty:''' Right now, are you in a warehouse…

'''Moriarty:''' Or the Ark?

'''Griseo:''' This…

The camouflage on the walls started peeling off at Moriarty’s gesture.

The facility hidden beneath the metal cover reappeared in front of Griseo. This was the place where she had spent countless millennia in slumber, where she had vowed to escape not long ago.

'''Griseo:''' How did you…

'''Moriarty:''' Oh, it was simple enough. I haven’t found a way to enter the Ark yet, but my beasts can. To tell you the truth, they are far more diligent than any subordinate I’ve ever had.

'''Moriarty:''' I told them to dismantle your dormancy capsule and install it here, as part of the warehouse.

'''Moriarty:''' I read some files from the Ark. It’s a good thing I learned your language, or else I would have never figured out the function of all the buttons, let alone devise a feasible plan.

'''Griseo:''' That’s why there are so many colors…

'''Moriarty:''' Colors? Ah, you mean that bizarre power of yours? I must admit, that was not part of the plan.

'''Moriarty:''' I merely maneuvered the scratches my monsters left when they moved the parts, like a master conductor finessing his orchestra, luring you into the cage with a tantalising morsel…

'''Moriarty:''' The only uncertainty was whether you’d be smart enough to notice the traces. But it appears I had no cause for concern.

'''Moriarty:''' My plan went swimmingly thanks to your ability.

'''Griseo:''' But… This was the only place without colors…

'''Griseo:''' How could you…

'''Moriarty:''' Hahaha! That was yet another lovely coincidence, Griseo. Even you must admit that luck is an indispensable factor in most artistic masterpieces.

'''Moriarty:''' Had the monsters been smart enough, I’d have let them finish the assembly on my behalf, which would have left behind even more warning colors.

'''Moriarty:''' But my paranoia dictated that I was the only one fit for such a demanding task, the most critical step of the plan.

'''Moriarty:''' So I created your new bedroom myself, Miss Griseo. Such a pity that we only met five minutes ago.

'''Moriarty:''' Do well to remember my colors.

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' (This man has no colors… All I see is a miasma…)

'''Moriarty:''' Alright, turn it up.

As the sleeping gas permeated the room, Griseo fell into an oneiric trance, barely registering Moriarty’s final words.

'''Moriarty:''' Sleep well, Miss Griseo. Send my greetings to the next era.

…

'''Moriarty:''' What do we have now…

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Griseo, Griseo! Wake up!

Purple was left hopeless next to the slumbering Griseo.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Moriarty, you…

'''Moriarty:''' I figured it wouldn’t work on you either.

'''Moriarty:''' MANTIS… that was the name on the files my monsters retrieved. I thought this being was far removed from pure humans…

'''Moriarty:''' The hypnotic device that works on her is useless to us. So it seems that you and I are further away from being human, and can even be considered as two of a kind.

'''Moriarty:''' A data-based lifeform versus artificial life… not much of a difference really, wouldn’t you say?

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' I don’t know what you’re talking about! I’m not like you!

'''Moriarty:''' Are you so sure? Well, it doesn’t matter. I have no intention of being like you.

'''Moriarty:''' You are the most inferior and the least capable of all the city representatives. Why would I want to resemble you in any way?

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' I… I…

'''Moriarty:''' Look in your heart, you know it to be true. Why else would you be assigned to do all the grunt work? At this very moment, what could you possibly do to defy me?

'''Moriarty:''' Do you know why you’re always glad to help, Harmonious Vita?

'''Moriarty:''' It’s because your amiability is your only saving grace.

…

…

'''Moriarty:''' Goodbye, Harmonious Vita.

'''Moriarty:''' Will <span style="color:#e13838;">you</span> be satisfied with her final performance?

====<u>Gameplay 41-12 - A Stranger From Afar</u>====
'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' No more waiting!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Sit tight, Red.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' But…

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' We’ve formulated a battle plan and prepared the roadblocks and traps. All that’s left for us is to wait for Purple and Griseo.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' But they’ve been gone for ages! You could have gone there and back three times over by now.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' They promised to contact us in case of an emergency, and we haven’t heard from them yet.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' But that could mean they’ve run into something more urgent than your run-of-the-mill emergency. Like a super emergency!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' I understand how you feel, but let’s be honest with ourselves; If they’re under attack by monsters, it’s not like we’ll be of any help anyway.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Holding this place will at least ensure that we can build a defensive line as soon as the smart bricks arrive.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Then… what if we contact Orange and Cyan who are with Fu Hua? Didn’t they send us a message saying everything’s fine?

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' I’ve been trying to contact them for the past few minutes, but I haven’t heard anything back… Maybe they’re also in an emergency.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Ugh! Can’t do this, can’t do that! I wanna pull my hair out!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Calm down, Red. Think of our rules. Even in case of an emergency…

Just while they were fretting, a familiar voice suddenly came from the streets outside…

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">???:</span>''' Righteous…! Disciplined…! Where are you?

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">???:</span>''' Righteous…! Disciplined…!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' That voice! It’s Purple! Purple’s back!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Purple? What about Griseo?

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' And why is she calling us by those names…?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Ah, I see her! Green, look!

She looked out the window in the direction of Righteous’ finger, and saw Harmonious hollering as she crossed the street.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' It’s really Purple… but…

Not waiting for Disciplined to voice her doubt, Righteous leaned out of the window and waved frantically.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Purple! We’re over here! Come on up!

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Ah, it’s Righteous…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Purple, why do you have to be so slow? You made me think something serious happened…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Hey, Green, let’s go get her! Those monsters could pop out at any minute!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Ah, Red, wait for me…

The two ran out of their hideaway one after the other.

Yet awaiting them outside the door, aside from their long-time colleague…

Was calamity itself.

…

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …!

Hordes of monsters appeared at the same time, as if by ambush.

And worse, they were escorting the one who called their names.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Righteous, Disciplined, so you’ve been hiding here.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Purple, why are you…

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …

Before Righteous could react, Disciplined grabbed her by the collar and attempted to retreat into the building.

However, she couldn’t even crack open the door, for a monster was pressing against it.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …Darn.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Red, use the window! Find Fu Hua and tell her what’s going on here!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Huh? But…

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Shut up! You’re a fast runner, you go first!

Disciplined even kicked Righteous hard to make her point.

Perhaps confused by the kick, perhaps spooked by Disciplined’s aura, Righteous darted out reflexively, without realising how strained her last reason was…

…

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Never!

The monsters that learned about the existence of the secret window wanted to intercept Righteous. However, Disciplined had already pressed a button.

…!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' (...The machine that places roadblocks ended up blocking my way.)

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' (But… this will do.)

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Moriarty! If you want to do anything, come at me!

Applause came from behind the walls of monsters.

'''Moriarty:''' Brilliant. Given how peaceful Phosphorus normally is, your maneuver has greatly exceeded my expectations.

'''Moriarty:''' I must say, you have outperformed the other representatives I’ve met so far. Perhaps you are more deserving of the title Mindful.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Blue… That means Yellow also…

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' And Purple, what did you do to her? Where is Griseo?

'''Moriarty:''' That’s a long story… I suggest you take it easy. You can’t rush answers, can you?

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Yeah, I’ve never seen Disciplined so grumpy… Looks like something’s really wrong with her! What do we do?

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …?!

'''Moriarty:''' Don’t worry, Harmonious, she’s only a little tired, and I happen to know a secret cure for fatigue.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Really?

'''Moriarty:''' When have I lied to you?

'''Moriarty:''' You can go find Mindful and the others. I can patch him up in a minute.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Okay, then I’m counting on you, Moriarty!

Harmonious nodded in relief and ran off.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' You… What did you do to her… Have Yellow and Blue also…

'''Moriarty:''' Don’t be so sensitive. I promise you that I’ve done them no harm, though this may sound unbelievable to you.

'''Moriarty:''' That is but a process that every Vita like you must undergo… and I, how should I put it… only brought it a little forward?

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' You’re telling me to believe in you after you harmed so many people and betrayed Yellow and Blue?! How dare you!

'''Moriarty:''' Oh… You don’t need to be so hostile to me. As I said earlier, I appreciate you.

'''Moriarty:''' Let’s talk about you. Your ability to improvise during a crisis and sacrifice yourself… What made you stay behind to cut off the enemy?

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Hmph, unlike you, I’m born with the rules of representatives in mind: “A Vita must not break the solidarity of Vitas, violate an agreement between Vitas…”

'''Moriarty:''' “...Abandon another Vita in need of help.”

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …!

'''Moriarty:''' And it is followed by “...or deceive another Vita for malicious purposes. A Vita must bear in mind that all Vitas are one and the same in service to our city. A Vita is allowed to fulfill their small wishes, so long as they do not compromise this premise”.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Why can you recite our…

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Did Purple tell you? No, she can’t even memorise them… Was it Blue? But…

Ignoring her questions, Moriarty continued to recite them line by line.

'''Moriarty:''' “When there are important matters to be discussed, the Assembly of Vitas will commence. It will only commence when all the available Vitas are present.”

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …

'''Moriarty:''' “Vitas assume different duties in the city. Their positions include inspector, culturist, auditor, judge, registrar, researcher, emcee…”

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' (This is wrong… He isn’t reciting our rules.)

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' (But why do they sound familiar…?)

'''Moriarty:''' “Every natural month, Vitas hold a performance review meeting, where the culturist and the judge reward the Vitas who excel in their line of work…”

'''Moriarty:''' “The shared goal of Vitas is to build a Phosphorus where everyone can live happily!”

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' (Very familiar… but very unfamiliar…)

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' (...Why?)

Accompanied by Moriarty’s cruel recitation, the monsters gradually approached Disciplined.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' (This abnormal sensation… What is this…)

'''Moriarty:''' You feel funny, don’t you? Would you like to know why?

'''Moriarty:''' Because what I’m reading to you are the rules of the past.

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Past…? What are you talking about?

'''Moriarty:''' The rules of the past. The rules prior to modification. Or to be more direct, the rules someone wrote cursorily long ago.

'''Moriarty:''' Do you understand? The rules you’ve adhered to since birth have been nothing more than a mass-produced mnemonic. The one who wrote it, that merciless Creator, simply cast a little spell over you… yet you must dedicate your life to it!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …Nonsense! Our rules aren’t… defined by anyone! They were discussed by us Vitas in our assemblies…

'''Moriarty:''' Is that so? Then why were the assemblies already customary before the rules existed?

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' …!

Moriarty’s words, like a stone-cold hammer, shattered Disciplined’s thoughts.

“Could the Phosphorus that everyone holds dearest be…”

Once a crack in thinking emerged, it could never be mended in place.

…

'''Moriarty:''' One, two, three, four. Good.

Looking at the unconscious Disciplined, a satisfied smile of counting loot formed on Moriarty’s face.

'''Moriarty:''' Did I go too far in my game? I can’t help feeling sorry, since they are <span style="color:#e13838;">your</span> cherished friends.

'''Moriarty:''' But worry not, as I will remedy the situation for <span style="color:#e13838;">you</span>. Now I’m quite familiar with tasks such as cleaning memories.

'''Moriarty:''' Even if I make a terrible mistake at some point, it would be fine. I trust <span style="color:#e13838;">you</span> will be able to handle it.

'''Moriarty:''' After stealing the authority from the hub, I can feel it… it’s getting closer and closer.

'''Moriarty:''' <span style="color:#e13838;">You</span> are rushing here at all costs, while trying to pry into me from time to time.

'''Moriarty:''' But prying alone is useless. What must be done, I will do them in order… <span style="color:#e13838;">You</span>, on the other hand, are unable to do anything.

''“...”''

'''Moriarty:''' …Mmm. In order to express my welcome to <span style="color:#e13838;">you</span>, I will quicken my pace and progress towards seven.

Meanwhile, Righteous, who was able to escape thanks to Disciplined’s reminder, was running forward with all her strength…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Huff, huff…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Faster, go faster!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (This is the time Green bought for me, I must put it to good use!)

As the last wisp of air left her lungs, a sharp pain began to distort her vision.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (I must… find the great detective… as soon as possible!)

Her vision was reduced to a blur and her legs moved mechanically. But this didn’t stop her from running toward the stronghold.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (If I get there… I can… save Green!)

The faint taste of blood in her mouth was cutting her apart. Her heart was boiling hot, but her limbs were ice-cold.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (I have to… get there!)

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' I did it! Great detec…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' H-How is this…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' The monsters… surrounded the stronghold!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (Dammit… Is the great detective’s party stuck in there?)

Monsters brandishing sharp claws prowled outside the stronghold, and the homely streets she grew up in had become a living hell.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (What should I do? There’s only… me…)

If it all transpired in a split second, then an unconscious move would’ve saved her the pain of hesitation.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (If I lure the monsters away, then the great detective can break through, and save Green and everyone else!)

Having made up her mind, she clenched her fists, took a deep breath, and ran toward the monsters with her own safety behind.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (Sorry, Green. Thinking long-term like you taught me just isn’t my style…)

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Hey! You monsters! I dare you to come after me!

Her shout was thunder over the plains. The monsters turned around to chase her at once.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (I did it!)

Seeing that the first step had succeeded, she immediately ran in the opposite direction. However, her fatigued body slowed her legs down, and they closed in on her with every step.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (I have to go faster! I have to lure them farther away!)

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (Faster! Red, you can do it! Just a little more, and everyone…)

…!

…

Her frail body, impaled by a long claw, slammed onto the ground she had patrolled countless times.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (My luck… sucks.)

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (Am I… far away enough?)

An unstoppable cold made her tremble uncontrollably.

She tried to recognise her surroundings, but the pain immobilised her, and her consciousness began to fade.

And then, a faraway sound pierced her mind and sent out ripples…

…

<span style="color:#d65252;">'''???:'''</span> “Hey! You monsters! I dare you to come after me!”

<span style="color:#8251c2;">'''???:'''</span> “Red! Don’t go! With everyone gone, you’re all I have!”

<span style="color:#d65252;">'''???:'''</span> “Don’t cry, Purple, don’t you have faith in me? Stay hidden until they’ve gone far away, understand?”

A blurry scene unfolded in her mind. She saw the red girl lure the monsters away and disappear at the end of an alley.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …Was that… a dream? But… why did I see myself?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' My head… it hurts…

…

<span style="color:#d65252;">'''???:'''</span> “Over here! Everyone, quickly! There will be aftershocks any minute now!”

“...!”

<span style="color:#d65252;">'''???:'''</span> “...”

<span style="color:#d65252;">'''???:'''</span> “Legs… I can’t feel my legs…”

<span style="color:#d65252;">'''???:'''</span> “Is… is everyone… alright…”

She saw the red girl evacuate citizens from the ruins until she was buried by boulders.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …There were… earthquakes?

…

<span style="color:#d65252;">'''???:'''</span> “Hold on! I’ll push you up!”

'''???:''' “No, Righteous, you’ll be swept away by the flood! Righteous…”

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' So it was… a flood…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Strange… Did all of those things… happen…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Why… can’t I remember…

Her body was losing heat by the second, yet her mind was ripped into vivid images by the torment of suffocation.

Torrents rushed down mountains and rivers flowed backward. Floodwaters devoured everything in their path, submerging people’s anguished wails and sweeping away everything she loved.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' “...Why?! It was just yesterday… when everyone was smiling!”

In the flooded city, the red girl used her last ounce of strength to push her colleague onto a rooftop before the floodwaters claimed her.

Muddy water rushed into her nose and mouth, and the tumbling rocks struck her body. And at the end of her life, she saw her colleague on the rooftop succumb to the same fate.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' “Why… why has it come to this?! Why?!”

She couldn’t do anything or save anyone.

There was no exception from beginning to end.

The pain and despair of the past ate away at her sanity, and the images in her mind faded until the shattered memories, along with her world, plunged into infinite darkness.

…

…

'''???:''' Red! Red!

The calling gently whisked away the blanket of fog, and so she was able to glimpse the sunlight amid the chaos.

As usual, she opened her eyes once more…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …Huh?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Finally! Orange, look, she’s awake!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' My head… so dizzy, the world is shaking! Ah… is it an earthquake?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Cyan, any more shaking and she’ll be hurt.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Ah, I’m so sorry, I’m just overjoyed.

The red girl rubbed her head, and under her colleagues’ concerned gaze, casually patted the dust from her clothes and stood up as if nothing had happened.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Ungh… I’m so dirty, did I fall? Whatever, I need to warn everyone of the danger now!

'''???:''' Red, are you okay?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' I’m fine, couldn’t be better… Wait a minute, who are you?

She stopped motioning abruptly and surveyed the stranger in front of her with curious, confused eyes.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Sh-She’s Fu Hua.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …

<tabber>
|-|[CHOICE] - Fu Hua=
<div style="line-height: 15px></div><br>
</tabber>

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …

<tabber>
|-|[CHOICE] - Who is… Fu Hua?=
<div style="line-height: 15px></div><br>
</tabber>

The girl scratched her head and tried to bring her to mind. She was certain she remembered every scenery and resident of Phosphorus, yet she couldn’t remember anything about Fu Hua.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Red… Are you okay?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Me? I’m fine, maybe all that running around investigating earthquakes made me sleepy and I tripped… I’m probably half-asleep!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Come on, don’t look at me like that… Orange, don’t reproach me for not resting well yet! I’ll take a nice long nap once I’m done notifying the neighborhood!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Fu Hua, Red is… acting strange… Why is this happening…

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' I’m not sure what caused this, but we can’t afford to discuss it here; those monsters may catch up anytime. We can do this after we get to safety.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Fu Hua’s right. Red, let’s leave with her first.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Wait, Orange, I haven’t notified everyone yet, how can I walk off with a stranger…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Red, Fu Hua has gone through a lot with us. She’s an extraordinary person who we can trust.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Cyan’s right. Red, you follow Fu Hua to safety first, then we explain everything to you. Please?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …Okay, I believe in Orange. After all, as our inspector, she can always draw the right decision from the tiniest of evidences!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Huh…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Inspector… Isn’t that you?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' What? How’s that possible? Orange is the inspector! Isn’t that right, Orange?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …Red, we’ll talk on the way. Let’s get out of here first.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (Weird… Orange and Cyan are super friendly with this Fu Hua… what an awkward-sounding name… who I haven’t heard of before.)

She followed her colleagues and eyed the foreigner walking abreast her curiously.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' (Orange and Cyan seem to trust her deeply, but I don’t remember her at all… Am I still half-asleep? Ah! She’s looking at me!)

'''Fu Hua:''' Red, do you remember what happened before you fell asleep?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' I… remember holding a megaphone and warning everyone of earthquakes… Huh? Where did my megaphone go?

She touched her empty belt and sighed in chagrin. But this wasn’t the only strange occurrence today, so she shook her head, only to meet the foreigner’s worried eyes.

'''Fu Hua:''' Then do you remember where Green is?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Green? You’re a foreigner, yet you already know her!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Hmm… Lately, there have been signs of earthquakes, so as the registrar, she’s naturally inspecting the reported places. She also said the river was rising yesterday and needed to check it against old records.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' But… Green has been with you… and isn’t she the judge of the city?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Huh? Cyan, you’re funny today! We all know Blue’s the judge! I never misremember anything about you guys!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Orange, did Cyan mess with me because he’s mad at me? Um, it’s my fault, I shouldn’t have scared him to the ground the other day.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Huh?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Heheh, that was a joke, I know Cyan isn’t petty like that! Cyan, let me see how your wound’s healing, I often get hurt, so I’m the best at treating wounds…

Her cheerful words came to an abrupt stop.

The moment her eyes fell on her brother, a chill ran up her neck… Righteous widened her eyes in disbelief.

It was a smooth arm. Not a single wound to be seen.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Cyan… the wound on your elbow… Where did it go?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Red, are you okay?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' C-Could it be…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Because you’re not them… you mixed up the duties of representatives…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' No no no, this is ridiculous…

'''???:''' But ridiculous things can happen.

'''???:''' I’m sorry to interrupt your conversation… I only wanted to dispel this lady’s doubt.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Another person I don’t know… Huh? Have I seen you somewhere?

'''???:''' Oh my, pardon me for not introducing myself.

'''Moriarty:''' Ladies, and this gentleman, I, Moriarty, send you my warmest regards!

'''Moriarty:''' And… how long has it been, my dear great detective? Ah, simply uttering that title has made me nostalgic.

'''Fu Hua:''' …Moriarty.

'''Moriarty:''' You seem to miss me badly as well. It feels marvelous to see you again. After all, my longing for you is as bitter as hatred.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' What you’ve done today… I don’t see it as a revenge on me.

'''Moriarty:''' Oh… my great detective, why do you always manage to sour the wonderful things in life? Must you waste our joyous reunion on irrelevant small talk?

'''Fu Hua:''' …Irrelevant?

'''Moriarty:''' Isn’t that so?

Moriarty looked at Fu Hua smiling before winking at Righteous, as if unwilling to miss a single move of anyone present.

'''Moriarty:''' What does everything here have to do with you? Or should I ask… who is the criminal that attracted the Honkai beasts to the city and threw its people into turmoil?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …?

'''Moriarty:''' The unidentified outsider has brought monsters, earthquakes, and immeasurable disaster to the peaceful inhabitants; worse, she is oblivious to it.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' You mean… the earthquake… was caused by the outsider?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Red, don’t believe him! He’s the real culprit!

'''Moriarty:''' Me? No no no, like you… I’m but a miserable worm living in a glass jar…

'''Moriarty:''' It is born on Monday, is named on Tuesday, socialises on Wednesday, labors on Thursday, suffers on Friday, is aided on Saturday, perishes on Sunday, and is reborn on Monday again.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

====<u>Gameplay 41-13 - Split</u>====
''[CG plays wherein Moriarty speaks of another kind of origin story, presumably of before the incident that destroyed Hesperus:''

'''''Moriarty:''' The star of miracles descended on the untouched paradise.''

'''''Moriarty:''' From that moment, the era of humans began.''

'''''Moriarty:''' Humans, alongside their divine companions, erected a thriving kingdom.''

'''''Moriarty:''' They devised calendars to predict the heavens.''

'''''Moriarty:''' They tilled the soil to measure the land.''

'''''Moriarty:''' As time passed, their legacy endured.''

'''''Moriarty:''' Human history became deeply rooted in this pristine land.''

'''''Moriarty:''' Prospering and flourishing… and then, declining.''

'''''Moriarty:''' On that fateful day, calamity veiled the sky, casting shadows over the earth.''

'''''Moriarty:''' Granting the gift of life-giving water to all living beings.''

'''''Moriarty:''' This time, it will bestow death upon the world.''

'''''Moriarty:''' The deluge swept away the remnants of civilisation…''

'''''Moriarty:''' The world descended into darkness, awaiting a new beginning in tranquility.'']

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Deluge…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' That… that deluge actually happened?

'''Moriarty:''' Oh? Looks like you’ve woken up from the illusion of happiness.

'''Moriarty:''' That’s right, Righteous Vita, those are your true experiences. How does it feel to have your memory back?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …?!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …No no no! You can see that Phosphorus is fine! How could that be real?

'''Moriarty:''' Hmm, this is a problem. In fact, you’ve asked a good question.

'''Moriarty:''' After all, the fate of this world works like clock hands: they will eventually point to the same position.

'''Moriarty:''' Had things not gone like this… my revenge at this moment would have been impossible.

'''Fu Hua:''' …So who are you exacting revenge on?

'''Moriarty:''' I hope you can find the answer to that question yourself. Your speculation was right, great detective… I did not come for you, but to honor my agreement with Mindful Vita.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Blue? Where is he? What have you done to him and Yellow?

'''Moriarty:''' …Nothing, they are only occupied at the moment.

'''Moriarty:''' In the face of a disaster that could destroy their home at any time, representatives such as them naturally prioritise eliminating the source of the disaster.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing</span> & <span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite</span>:''' …?!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Destroy…? Wait! Are you saying…

'''Moriarty:''' Yes, like the deluge in your memory. I have said that the fate of this world works like clock hands, as they will eventually point to the same position.

'''Moriarty:''' An obvious conclusion, is it not? The existence of Hesperus is the best proof. In the unchanging world, people circle in falsehoods…

Moriarty sneered, and his gaze fell on Fu Hua.

'''Moriarty:''' And now, thanks to the arrival of an uninvited guest, the cogs of fate are turning faster.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' What are you… talking about?

'''Moriarty:''' Oh. It’s normal that you don’t remember. A breed of peculiar monsters has appeared in the city… Honkai beasts, according to the great detective… and it is they that have doomed the city.

'''Moriarty:''' And all in all… they appeared in Phosphorus alongside the great detective standing before us.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …

Hearing that, Red instinctively threw off Encompassing’s hand and took two steps back warily.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Red! Calm down. Moriarty is just reversing cause and effect.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' After coming here, Fu Hua has been helping us destroy the Honkai beasts. Have you really forgotten it all?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Red… Fu Hua saved you, can’t you remember anything? Even if you don’t… as a representative, you should be able to decide for yourself!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' I… I…

Four pairs of eyes looked at her in unison.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …

A short but difficult silence. Suddenly, Red clutched her head painfully.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Aaaaah!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' This is so weird! We all know a disaster’s coming, and the world might be destroyed…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' We’re supposed to be tackling this crisis together, but why is this happening to me?!

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Two outsiders both look like they’re trying to trick me, and Orange and Cyan are acting strange…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' What am I supposed to doooo…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing</span> & <span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite</span>:''' …

'''Moriarty:''' …

…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Red?! Where are you going?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' I don’t know if you’re the real Orange and Cyan, but you got one thing right…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' As a representative, I can decide for myself! I’ll get to the bottom of it!

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Red…

'''Moriarty:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' (...Strange, Moriarty didn’t stop her?)

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Oh no, there are Honkai beasts all around the city…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' We can’t let her go like this. Let’s chase her!

…

'''Moriarty:''' …So it’s just as Veracious Vita said, this Vita is quite impulsive.

'''Moriarty:''' Since she wishes to see everything that’s happening in the city for herself, I suggest neither of us intervenes for fairness’ sake.

'''Fu Hua:''' Orange, Cyan, get back!

'''Fu Hua:''' It’s over. Where’s Moriarty?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' He left in the chaos. I wonder if he’ll go see Red…

'''Fu Hua:''' But he knows we’d never sit back and watch our friends suffer.

'''Fu Hua:''' (I haven’t heard anything from Griseo either…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (But if he’s still the old Moriarty I know…)

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' What’s wrong, Fu Hua?

'''Fu Hua:''' Moriarty is observant and adaptable. He strikes others as a wild card, but when it comes to solving a problem, he takes the most direct approach.

'''Fu Hua:''' Once, he used a city’s criminal network to stall me until he secretly scouted out the portal to another world, so he could get rid of me by tricking me into it.

'''Fu Hua:''' I fear… he’s doing the same to the other Vitas… and even Griseo.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' This is bad! Red, Blue, Yellow, Griseo… Aren’t they all isolated?!

'''Fu Hua:''' Yes… We need to catch up, but also guard against traps.

'''Fu Hua:''' The monsters’ abnormal property, Red’s memory loss, Moriarty’s knowledge of a dubious origin… and my coincidental reunion with Griseo… There are just too many unanswered questions.

'''Fu Hua:''' Orange, Cyan, no matter what happens next… Don’t go out of my sight, okay?

--

====<u>Gameplay 41-14 - Ensnaring Net</u>====
'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' More of those monsters!

'''Fu Hua:''' Since Moriarty is trying to stop us, that must mean we’re on the right track.

'''Fu Hua:''' Again…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Ah!

'''Fu Hua:''' Watch out!

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' The projection is distorting again… what’s so special about these monsters?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Fu Hua! Your body just… Are you okay?

'''Fu Hua:''' It’s nothing, it isn’t the first time. It’s just that my body is susceptible to these strange creatures… This hasn’t hindered me so far, though.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …But this doesn’t happen when your enemy is a Honkai beast?

'''Fu Hua:''' Yes. This goes to show that they are fundamentally different from regular Honkai beasts.

'''Fu Hua:''' But now our biggest problem is… all that fighting has made the tracks of Red and Moriarty difficult to lock down.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' (In the end… we’ve been nothing but trouble to Fu Hua… I’m so useless…)

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Since Red said she’ll be searching the city, she’s bound to go everywhere she knows well. Maybe we can look along her patrol route?

'''Fu Hua:''' …You have a point. Let’s do it.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' What’s wrong, Cyan?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I feel like someone’s watching us… It must just be me.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Hmm? There are also enemies in this direction?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Could it be that the gaze I felt was theirs?

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' What’s going on… It’s becoming more frequent…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' There are too many monsters for us to go anywhere… Fu Hua, what should we do?

'''Fu Hua:''' Moriarty wasn’t capable of controlling monsters… So there should be a limit to the number of monsters he can control directly.

'''Fu Hua:''' He most likely arranged these ambushes. After all, it’s easy to predict how we’ll act under the present circumstances…

'''Fu Hua:''' (But being able to set up a series of ambushes in such a short time…)

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I think Moriarty’s doing this to get to Red and persuade her before we can.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' The horrible things he told us about… An amnesiac Red… What is this all about…?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Don’t worry, Red may have lost some memories, but she’s still Red.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' When it comes to Red, Yellow, and Blue, regardless of what happened, I believe they won’t make choices that go against their hearts.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' After all, we’ve been together since the day Phosphorus was built. I believe in them as much as I believe in myself.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Moriarty’s fraud won’t last long. Let’s talk about it after we find Red.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Yeah.

Erudite nodded, but he couldn’t name the uneasiness in his heart.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' (Could it really be that simple…?)

'''???:''' “Yeah, could it really be that simple?”

'''Fu Hua:''' Who’s there?

'''Vi:''' It’s me, Vi.

'''Vi:''' Thanks to your repeated battles against the Paradise Wardens, I have this rare chance to talk to you.

'''Fu Hua:''' Paradise Wardens?

'''Vi:''' Ah, the type of monsters that affect the stability of your avatar. Strictly speaking, they’re the natives of Phosphorus and even this planet… but that’s a long story.

'''Vi:''' Long story short…

…

'''Vi:''' Now do you understand why I lied to you earlier?

====<u>Gameplay 41-15 - Lost</u>====
Meanwhile, outside the sea of Fu Hua’s consciousness…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Orange… What just…

Just dozens of seconds ago, the two Vitas watched the great detective that they had looked up to rapidly morph into various forms and then vanish into thin air.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' I… I don’t know…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Fu Hua seemed like she was forcing herself…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …

The two who suddenly lost their backbone were at a loss for what to do.

Fear, confusion, helplessness… All the pressure pushed down on them abruptly like a rock weighing a thousand pounds…

…

Nonetheless, they were the representatives of Phosphorus and had dealt with various crises together.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Cyan, Fu Hua will be alright. She’s entered the forbidden area alone before… and even rescued Griseo in the end!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Yeah.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Since Fu Hua suddenly went missing, we have all the more reason to get moving! We came here to look for Red…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' So maybe we should do something to get her attention!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Huh…?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' When we parted, Red was very wary of Fu Hua and Moriarty… So I’m guessing that maybe it’s not that we can’t find her, but she’s avoiding them.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' But… now that we’ve lost Fu Hua’s protection and are on our own… If we stand in Red’s shoes and think the way she does…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' I know this is very risky, but…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' In any case, I want to… talk to Red.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

After being silent for quite a while, Erudite finally took out a marked map.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' This is… the festival map you found at the base of the Young Villains Crew?

Erudite nodded.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Blue would never leave us a useless clue… So maybe we can investigate all the marked spots in order.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' If Moriarty sends monsters to obstruct us, then this map is related to his plan. Otherwise, Blue’s trying to tell us something else.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' And… from Red’s perspective… The festival is held in the busiest districts of the city, so she will definitely notice us.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Cyan, that’s brilliant! Once Fu Hua gets back, we can rally all the Vitas, and Griseo too… to take on Moriarty!

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' No time to lose Let’s go!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Ah… okay.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Huh? Orange… did you hear anything?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Hmm… No…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Then I… probably misheard…

Contrary to Erudite’s conclusion, in a corner that escaped their notice, there was a pair of eyes watching everything calmly.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

Stepping over the remains of Honkai beasts, Mindful silently followed the two who were walking along the festival route.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Orange, how is it?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Hmm… No signs of monsters. Safe!

Two fluffy heads poked out of the corner of a sunny street.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' This was a booth at the last festival… Now nothing’s here.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' It’s just a festival, people still need to go back to their normal lives afterward. The festival may be over, but what matters is that everyone remembers it fondly.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' You’re right.

Erudite smiled in response, but that smile soon froze and disappeared as his eyes began to droop.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Cyan, what’s wrong?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I… I’m just thinking of the situation. Not long ago, Phosphorus… Qiming was full of life. Who’d have thought that in one day…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Don’t worry, Cyan. We’ve handled countless crises in the past, and we can handle this one. Once it’s over, we’ll hold an even bigger celebration… Everything will be alright.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Yeah!

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' We’d better hurry and investigate if Blue has left any clues for us nearby.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' We didn’t find anything… Hope we have better luck at the next location…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Orange, we’re there.

Encompassing nodded and looked around, a tinge of worry creeping up her face.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' This place is conspicuous enough, but Red still hasn’t shown up…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Where did she run off to… I hope she’s safe.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' (And Griseo’s party that split with us… No, I can’t let it all get to me now, I need to focus on the task at hand…)

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Orange…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …I’m fine, let’s search for clues.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' We still can’t find anything…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Yeah, we can only move on to the last location.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' The last marker should be here… We’re lucky we didn’t run into any monsters.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' But there’s nothing here. Why did Blue leave this clue?

The two inspected everything around them, leaving no stone unturned. But just like before, there was nothing that caught their eye. Neither Blue nor Moriarty had left any information here.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' (Maybe this map has some other purpose. But what can a map do besides show directions?)

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Ah… So this is the place.

Encompassing suddenly pointed to a wall with a few words scrawled on it and left out a soft sigh.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Now I remember which celebration was held here. It was the fireworks festival three years ago, right?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' I remember Red got so excited that she almost made a mess of everything. Luckily, Miss Vita was there to prevent it.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' But Red, where are you now…?

At the thought of her estranged sister who left her not long ago, Encompassing sighed unwittingly again.

Then her eyes suddenly widened.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Cyan, look over there…

Not too far behind them, a small head had poked out from behind a wall and was looking at them.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Is that… Blue?!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Blue…!

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Orange, Cyan, it’s been a long time.

The familiar sound of their brother’s voice nearly moved them to tears. Just when Encompassing opened her mouth to say hello…

Her face froze.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Blue, look out!

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …?

Mindful paused. He then looked at the giant alien monster behind him and gave a knowing smile.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Don’t worry, like Moriarty, I have power over it. It obeys me and won’t hurt anyone. Actually, that’s why I was able to neutralise the Honkai beasts along the way.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Oh… That explains it.

Cyan scratched his head in embarrassment.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I sensed someone following us and heard Honkai beasts, though only faintly. Was that you, Blue?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Yes, more Honkai beasts have appeared in the city. I was worried about you getting hurt, so I followed you all the way. I didn’t catch up with you until that outsider Fu Hua left without saying goodbye.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …?

There was something strange about Mindful’s statement. Before Erudite could ask him about Fu Hua, Encompassing was tugging the hem of his shirt.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' We’re also confused about what’s going on with Fu Hua… But have you seen Red? For some reason, something’s wrong with her memory. We had a misunderstanding and she ran off alone.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Don’t worry, I ran into her when she was surrounded by Honkai beasts in the city. She’s safe now.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' I’m so relieved to hear that. Why does she have to be so reckless?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' That’s Red for you. Did I hear you talking about her just now?

After learning that Red was safe, Encompassing was at ease. She couldn’t help smiling as they reminisced.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Blue, do you remember the fireworks festival three years ago? Red had the wild idea of preserving a firework at the moment of explosion in the museum.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Unsurprisingly, she failed, which caused a power outage and temporarily disabled her representative access. If Miss Vita hadn’t happened to be there, who knows how long Red would’ve been locked inside the museum.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Green gave us a hard time for that.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' She can be strict, but she means well. After Red wrote her an apology, she offered to make it up to her with something else.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …Is that so? I can’t remember.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' How come? If it weren’t for your clue, we wouldn’t…

Erudite suddenly realised.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' (Is this why Blue left this map? Like he reminded us of the time we stole that pudding…)

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' (...Wait. If he wanted to use our memory for a clue, why is he pretending to not remember?)

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' (Didn’t we already say the right answer…?)

Thinking on his feet, he coughed and shifted the topic awkwardly.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Ahem, Blue, Moriarty hinted that we need to pay a price to learn the truth about the world. You… haven’t done anything like that yet, right?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Yeah, Blue, you need to think it over. You’re the smartest and most intelligent among us… but Fu Hua told us he’s a cunning criminal.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Be careful not to let him trick you.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Fu Hua? Sounds like you trust her a lot.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' What’s she like?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Ah, right, you haven’t gotten to know her yet. When we were attacked by Honkai beasts earlier, we would’ve been in a lot of trouble had she not rescued us…

Encompassing and Erudite recounted their journey with Fu Hua. Mindful only listened in silence.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …That’s everything we experienced together. You see, she’s just as clever as Moriarty, but the difference is she isn’t conniving or conspiring.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' And… you just saw with your own eyes. To protect us, Fu Hua has been battling those monsters Moriarty summoned…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Blue, join us to find Fu Hua and her friend. As long as we work together, we don’t need Moriarty to find the source of the monsters and learn the truth about this world.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

Instead of responding, Mindful only looked at the two in silence. His face gradually grew sad.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …I’m sorry.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' What’s wrong, Blue? Why are you apologising?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Sorry, we should’ve warned you, or taken you away at least…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Did you know that either being able to enter the forbidden area or being rejected by this world…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Is proof that she is an invader to Phosphorus and has brought calamity upon us all?

With a sigh, he closed his eyes and fell silent again. Only then did Erudite notice something bubbling within him…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' It was her and her friend, both foreign bodies to this world, that fabricated your memories… so that you forget the catastrophe… whether they’re aware of it or not.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' And that’s the real reason… that we cannot enter the forbidden area.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Orange, something’s wrong!

Before Encompassing could react, Erudite had grabbed her by the hand and was going to run in the opposite direction from Mindful.

Yet the next moment, his path was blocked by several familiar figures.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Red…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Don’t stand still, Orange! They’ve forgotten what happened and believe our memories are fake!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' We need to run!

'''Moriarty:''' You see… once again we have come to the same conclusion. My fellow Vitas…

'''Moriarty:''' In the unchanging world, people circle in falsehood.

…What’s going on?

Until now, Encompassing still couldn’t process the situation.

Her sisters and brother were clutching her and Erudite’s arms so tightly that they couldn’t move an inch… as if they were being restrained.

'''Moriarty:''' I know you must be so confused. That would leave anyone helpless.

'''Moriarty:''' Allow me to explain what actually happened… Hmm, where should I begin?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …Let me do it.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' It’s all because of my poor judgment that you lost your memories of the catastrophe. And those two outsiders…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' They may really want to help us… but that doesn’t mean they aren’t still the deadliest enemies to Phosphorus.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …?

Even in her daze, Encompassing roughly understood what was behind it all. She felt as if a bucket of ice water had been poured over her head, causing her teeth to chatter.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Blue, is this a joke? There’s nothing wrong with our memory! The truth is that Moriarty took away your memories!

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …Memory is not reality; it is relative but not absolute. So I observed Fu Hua and Moriarty equally, us and you…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Until I could conclude who is more detached from reality for Phosphorus.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' For that reason, I’ve negotiated with Moriarty to not clash head-on with that outsider, but to test her with Paradise Wardens, one of Phosphorus’ weapons against the catastrophe.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' You’re saying… you sent the monsters that obstructed us and even attacked us on purpose?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' They are not monsters. As I said, they’re one of Phosphorus’ weapons against the catastrophe. They wouldn’t hurt you, they were only there to help you remember what exactly happened in this world.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Of course… being forced to remember is an excruciating process. I don’t want you to undergo the same process.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' So… you came to check in on us…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' But I still don’t understand. What’s your proof that outsiders can fabricate our memories?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Yeah! Are you trying to tell us that the fireworks festival and all that time we spent together are fake?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, Purple… What’s wrong with you? Why has it come to this?

…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Can this one accusation do away with all those great times we spent together? Even if you wanted to, you still need to show us the proof!

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Orange, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to break your heart. But… none of us went to that fireworks festival.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' And… in terms of your forgetting the catastrophe… whether that fireworks festival existed or not… isn’t that important anymore.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …What are you talking about, Blue?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' “In the unchanging world, people circle in falsehoods.” Do you understand what Moriarty was referring to?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' As told by myths, a catastrophe destroyed our first home. But do you still remember that each of us has died in the catastrophe… more than once, even?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Do you still remember that the conditions to activate the Artifact, in addition to the consensus of all Vitas, also included the sacrifice of all Vitas?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing</span> & <span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite</span>:''' …What?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Every day in Phosphorus is supposed to be an ordinary day in unchanging times.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' But… why does the catastrophe exist? What is the Artifact designed to combat?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Only when we have remembered everything can we realise…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' The only variable in this world is the outsider.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' This…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Blue, this is too much…

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Orange, don’t worry. If we use Moriarty’s technology, we can restore your memory in no time.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' The beautiful past won’t disappear…. We never went to the fireworks festival, because we went to the lantern festival in real memory

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' We’ll always be family… nothing can change that!

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' No, that’s not the point…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' They’re both outsiders, why would you rather believe in Moriarty than Fu Hua?

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' If outsiders are intrinsically detrimental to Phosphorus, then Moriarty and the museum…

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Because Moriarty happens to be a museum piece. And museum pieces… are a part of Phosphorus.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Don’t worry, you’ll remember soon enough.

Following Mindful’s command, a Paradise Warden towered behind Encompassing and Erudite.

…!

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' …Ahhhh!

…

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' Cyan! Run! Get anyone you can!

…!!

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Orange… why…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …We’ll look for Cyan later.

Encompassing’s frail frame was engulfed by that huge shadow once more.

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' It might hurt a bit… but don’t be scared, I’ve prepared your favorite candy for you~

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' The Orange we know, please come back.

…

'''Moriarty:''' Sleep, Encompassing Vita.

'''Moriarty:''' Don’t worry, you’ll create plenty of new memories.

Anyhow, with the help of Encompassing, some were lucky enough to escape the center of chaos for the time being.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

Cyan had never thought that escape could be something so desperate.

Even though he was dashing left and right through the alleys at full speed, the horde of huge monsters controlled by Moriarty continued to close in on him.

He didn’t know where… or who he could run to.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' (It’s too late… What do I do… What do I do…)

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' (Wait a minute… there’s one more clue!)

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' (Blue… The clue he left in the warehouse… We still haven’t…)

A thought suddenly hit Erudite.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' (I know, the camera…!)

Before he could think, he had raised his camera, pretended to aim it at the monsters, and hurled it to their side.

…

…!

The world turned upside down. He felt himself fall to the ground, but it didn’t hurt. The rolls of film in his arms tumbled to the ground, like the memories he was about to part with.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' (I beg you, Fu Hua, if you can make it back, please find…)

…

…

'''???:''' Haha, good, it’s decided then. Collect everyone’s wishes and open them a few years later, just like wine. If anyone’s wish doesn’t come true… we’ll laugh at them~

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' If we just want to preserve good memories and the moment of wishing, this is the way.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Blue, I knew you’d come up with a great way quickly! I’ll be the first to make a wish!

'''<span style="color:#b9dd36;">Disciplined Vita:</span>''' Aside from Red, no one would be dumb enough to put an exploding firework in the museum.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Green’s right, I’m not good at using my head… but that’s not a problem, because I have you guys.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Then I’ll get everyone some notepaper to write down wishes~

'''<span style="color:#e78c40;">Encompassing Vita:</span>''' What a sight to be remembered. Cyan, why don’t you take a photo of us?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Okay! Is everyone ready? Say cheese…

There was a flash of white light.

And then all memories disappeared in a deafening rumble.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' What a heavy flood… No… No…

'''Moriarty:''' …

'''Moriarty:''' Congratulations, you also got a peek into the reality of this world.

'''Moriarty:''' But… why must all of you choose such an agonising method?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

'''Moriarty:''' Looks like I won’t be able to get an answer… Forget it, let’s move on to the next step of the plan.

…

'''Moriarty:''' …Erudite Vita? Are you alright? Your companions are still waiting for you.

--

====<u>Gameplay 41-16 - Blind Spot</u>====
A little earlier, an unknown place.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Vi:''' …

'''Vi:''' …Um, aren’t you gonna say anything?

'''Fu Hua:''' I don’t think you’ve told me the entire truth.

'''Fu Hua:''' You claimed to be the real representative of Phosphorus, straining herself to combat this catastrophe… But I haven’t been able to verify that yet.

'''Fu Hua:''' Not to mention you just tried to trick me in the forbidden area, which makes you even less believable.

'''Vi:''' Um, maybe. But according to my calculations, in two minutes Phosphorus time, your projection will reappear in Phosphorus’ reality.

'''Fu Hua:''' You can calculate that but you still want to steal my body?

'''Vi:''' You could’ve said it less accusingly. It’s my duty to save Phosphorus, and even I can feel guilty if I keep troubling you to do so.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' The way you talk reminds me of an acquaintance of Moriarty’s. In a bad way.

'''Vi:''' If I had the time, I’d love to share Moriarty’s story with you. But since you think I’m so untrustworthy… Well then, in two minutes…

'''Vi:''' …Ah.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Vi:''' Shoot, why are there only ten seconds left?! Anyway, you take care of that for me! As soon as you disconnect…

…

…

The long-projected disturbance ended there. Fu Hua, who was returning to Phosphorus’ reality, was not yet aware that Moriarty had reset the memory of all Vitas and sent Griseo into a slumber.

Even so, a strange sense of emptiness did linger in her mind as her projection reified under some external interference. That feeling did not concern reality, but stemmed from an ancient memory.

It was the first night after the Ark set sail for the second time. She sat on the stairs of the Sanctuary, counting stars while making an extravagant interstellar call to Griseo.

They talked about the oceans, the snow mountains, and the forests. She noticed for the first time that the forest ground was actually several different shades of gray, and the gaps between branches allow sunlight to pass through and slowly warm the ground.

Even dark areas were graced by light. That’s how new trees grew, reflecting a shiny green off their sun-facing side. The sky wasn’t always blue, but the new sprouts always had the most beautiful green.

Under the night sky, every thirty minutes when the Ark turned to the dark side of the Earth, they greeted each other and enjoyed the hard-earned tranquility together on either side of the electric waves.

Occasionally they would talk, but for the most part, they just stared into the ocean of stars.

Deep under the ground or above the sky, they had quiet slumbers lasting millennia, but the silence that night was like a flame that would never go out.

The flame came with crackling sounds… like farmland immersed in the autumn mist.

The red sun. The withered plants. The rising smoke.

Now.

'''Fu Hua:''' (…)

'''Fu Hua:''' I did come back to the reality of Phosphorus…

'''Fu Hua:''' I don’t see anyone… During the time I was affected by Vi… what in the world happened here?

'''Fu Hua:''' She claimed to be the real representative of Phosphorus… Then her relation to the little Vitas…

'''Fu Hua:''' And what was she trying to say at the end…?

'''Fu Hua:''' Did I see something reflecting light?

'''Fu Hua:''' This is…!

A broken camera quietly lying on the ground.

Fu Hua was sure the owner of this camera was still smiling bashfully at her not long ago.

She picked up the camera. Only vacant and calm streets around her.

'''Fu Hua:''' Oh, Cyan…

If this had happened to Cyan, the fate of Orange was almost certain.

Fu Hua took a brief moment to calm her breathing. Right now, too many people were waiting for her to find.

It was precisely at this moment, she found something that didn’t match the evidence.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Weird. Cyan took this camera with him all the time, and he was unlikely to fight the monsters back when he was attacked…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (But the camera is badly damaged… Was it done on purpose by the monsters… or him?)

She opened the camera and a used roll of film dropped out.

'''Fu Hua:''' (I knew it…)

When looking for clues earlier, Cyan handed the film in the camera to the teenager in the warehouse, but the camera was now loaded. The film might well be the message Cyan left behind.

'''Fu Hua:''' (I remember Cyan said it was instant film and didn’t require development, so it should be able to…)

Fu Hua took the film out of the film chamber and saw a small soft image.

'''Fu Hua:''' (A group shot?)

There were eight people in the shot. Besides the seven child Vitas, there was a young girl standing in the middle.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Is this Vi? The Vitas’ big sister?)

'''Fu Hua:''' That should be the place in the photo. I should <span style="color:#ffe14b;">go take a look</span> to be safe.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Doesn’t look special.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Doesn’t look special.)

'''Fu Hua:''' Huh? This brick…

Fu Hua carefully lifted up the brick and revealed a box sitting in the dirt. The moment she opened the box, numerous notes flew out like snowflakes.

'''Fu Hua:''' Is this a… box of wishes?

More than ten notes carrying different wishes dropped onto the ground. Clearly, someone put their wishes into a time capsule and buried it here.

'''Fu Hua:''' “I’d rather do it this way than wishing on fleeting fireworks. I’m making a wish here… to fulfill everyone’s wish!” It was signed by Red.

'''Fu Hua:''' It does look like something from Red, only…

'''Fu Hua:''' Why is there also an accident report?

The language used in the report was the same as that of Phosphorus, which came from Mu. It was Griseo’s mother tongue and the Ark’s working language. Fu Hua flipped the report and got to know it all.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Keeping fireworks in the museum… Red had such a unique idea. But compared to the other bizarre items in the museum, this one doesn’t seem too weird.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (This says that if the museum is subjected to energy impacts of the same origin, the facilities might stop working and the exhibits might go wrong. Red shut down certain showcases by mistake which led to the energy leak…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Energy with the same origin… an accident similar to a circuit breaker tripping… the showcases and exhibits…)

'''Fu Hua:''' …!

'''Fu Hua:''' Could it be…

Fu Hua froze after flipping to the next page.

The report kept a detailed account of how to open or close the showcases and how to cut off the power.

'''Vi:''' Shoot, why are there only ten seconds left?! Anyway, you take care of that for me! As soon as you cut off…

The museum’s power.

It wasn’t until then that Fu Hua realised something she had long neglected… the nemesis she had met again after a hundred years was no more than an exhibit in a private museum.

And the other exhibits in the museum were practically all holo-projections.

'''Fu Hua:''' (I see…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Thank you, Cyan.)

Fu Hua carefully collected the scattered notes and buried them under the brick.

'''Fu Hua:''' I should go to the museum.

'''Fu Hua:''' (...Ah, I forgot that to open the museum door, besides unlocking the mechanism, I also need Cyan to open the hidden door.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (With the Vitas missing, can I break the door by force?)

Fu Hua thought about it with self-ridicule before she laid her hands on the door, but…

The door wasn’t locked to begin with.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

--

====<u>Gameplay 41-17 - Deer Hunter</u>====
The museum was just like when she visited the last time. Quiet, vacant, and without living things, it seemed out of touch with all sorts of chaos outside in the city.

The only difference was that this time she wasn’t accompanied by two chattering guides.

'''Fu Hua:''' The clock is ticking. Better get right to it.

'''Fu Hua:''' The control system is intact. The way to open it is…

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Griseo? How is this…

'''Moriarty:''' You appear surprised.

'''Moriarty:''' How was the surprise I prepared for you? Do you like it?

Though mentally prepared for the situation… Red losing her memory, Cyan’s camera broken, and Griseo probably in trouble too… Fu Hua was still taken aback by what she saw.

'''Fu Hua:''' Moriarty? You came uninvited.

'''Moriarty:''' Of course. An entrance is not complete without a bit of surprise, my dear old friend.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Where are the Vitas?

'''Moriarty:''' Don’t worry. They just satisfied their curiosity and are ready to work harder to fulfill their roles as the city representatives.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' (He doesn’t mean…)

'''Moriarty:''' That’s right, they now fully understand the world they live in, just like Red, but to get some memories back, you lose some others in the process.

'''Moriarty:''' The next time you see them, it’ll be the first time all over again. Isn’t that fun?

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Moriarty:''' I did plan to meet you here. After all, I masterminded a crime of such scale, and it would be a huge shame if it goes without an audience.

'''Moriarty:''' But Mindful Vita disturbed my plan. To keep the show going, I had to put on a few side shows to make the story more fluent.

'''Moriarty:''' But luck is on my side. Judging from the outcome, the story turns out to be even better than I expected, with a lot more guests on stage.

'''Fu Hua:''' (He means… locking Griseo into the dormancy capsule again was just for fun?)

'''Fu Hua:''' (“Crime of such scale”... what is he talking about?)

'''Moriarty:''' Yes, like the deluge in your memory. I have said that the fate of this world works like clock hands, as they will eventually point to the same position.

'''Moriarty:''' An obvious conclusion, is it not? The existence of Hesperus is the best proof. In the unchanging world, people circle in falsehoods…

'''Moriarty:''' And now, thanks to the arrival of an uninvited guest, the cogs of fate are turning faster.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Considering Moriarty’s typical way of speaking… could the unexpected guest be…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (But if it’s true, why would he lay his hands on Griseo and confront me?)

'''Fu Hua:''' Enough, Moriarty. No need for all the smoke and mirrors.

'''Fu Hua:''' You pulled the strings to take away the Vitas’ trust in me just to take revenge on me? I don’t think that’s all your plan is about.

'''Fu Hua:''' We found your diary. Apart from the city itself, you seem to be interested in the forbidden area too. What are you up to?

'''Moriarty:''' That’s for you to find out, dear detective.

'''Moriarty:''' In the equation I’m now pursuing, you’re not the variable that matters the most.

'''Moriarty:''' But you might well be the most fun one.

'''Moriarty:''' For example, when talking with me, you looked at the data console four times, and moved your eyes away every time when I noticed.

'''Moriarty:''' I don’t know if you were trying to trick me… but now I have a way to find out. I believe…

'''Moriarty:''' This is going to be a contest of endurance.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Moriarty:''' Hmm, it’s this strange phenomenon again. My old friend… I assume you don’t understand why this is happening?

'''Moriarty:''' You’re truly a Valkyrie. You’ve been perfecting your combat skills over the years, yes?

'''Fu Hua:''' No… I won’t have a chance to touch the panel if I keep fighting these monsters as a projection.

'''Fu Hua:''' Moriarty is right, this is a contest of endurance.

'''Moriarty:''' Alas… How I wish I had the same command over my body, so I could spar with you in person.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' As my battle against these monsters drags on, the distortion of the projection worsens…

'''Fu Hua:''' Paradise Wardens… That’s what Vi called these monsters. The question is, why am I targeted by them?

'''Fu Hua:''' If they’re truly the protectors of Phosphorus… What on earth is this world afraid of?

'''Moriarty:''' …?

'''Moriarty:''' Interesting. Compared to the last time, your endurance seems to have grown? Did you receive help from an outside expert during the short while after your body had disappeared?

'''Fu Hua:''' (Is he talking about Vi?)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Come to think about it, no one I’ve run into in Phosphorus… not even Vi… explains why I projected myself here.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Who is it indeed?)

'''Moriarty:''' …You’re distracted again, my dear detective.

…!

Fu Hua narrowly dodged the Paradise Warden’s attack. The resonating shockwaves in the museum caused the floor to reverberate.

'''Moriarty:''' …Running out of stamina, my dear detective? Fighting using your projection turns out to be a disappointment.

'''Moriarty:''' But suppose you grace this place in the flesh, my body might have turned cold now.

…!

Despite the taunt, Moriarty didn’t go easy on Fu Hua.

Just like the last attack, it sent the whole museum shaking. Fu Hua was hit by the shockwaves that followed.

'''Fu Hua:''' (...Alright.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (The time is now!)

In this contest of endurance, Fu Hua deliberately maneuvered her projection so that every time the monster hit her, she got closer to the console without attracting Moriarty’s direct attention.

Only when she didn’t achieve her goal and manage to push the button on the console…

…

She saw the satirical smile on Moriarty’s face.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Not the same as the accident report? But…)

…

'''Moriarty:''' …Ah.

'''Moriarty:''' Looks like it’s time to end this farce. Cheating goes against my aesthetics.

Suddenly, Fu Hua felt a mighty force that made it a hard struggle for her to stand straight.

Meanwhile, her body became faint and almost faded away.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?!

'''Moriarty:''' Curious about why I chose this place for the surprise? Time to reveal the answer.

'''Moriarty:''' Pity that you didn’t stay here for long to savor the most interesting part of the museum.

'''Moriarty:''' To make sure the projections of her bizarre exhibits collected from different places can be sent to the museum in time, the manager set up a conduit to transfer the projections under the console.

'''Moriarty:''' Of course, it goes both ways… and as a projection from the outside world, you’re no exception.

'''Moriarty:''' Sounds familiar? Yeah, this is the climax of the show… not quite the climax of all the performances, but it pleases me well enough.

'''Moriarty:''' …Just when you finally manage to push the button, you get to enjoy the exhilarating feeling of falling out of this world as if riding down a waterfall.

'''Moriarty:''' During your fall, you can think about one question:

'''Moriarty:''' In which form does the button that can imprison me in the showcase exist?

'''Moriarty:''' It’s alright if you don’t have the answer.

'''Moriarty:''' Goodbye, my dear great detective.

'''Moriarty:''' Good riddance. All external disturbances have been removed… for now, at least.

'''Moriarty:''' Time is of the essence. I shall set off my next criminal plan right away.

'''Moriarty:''' Oh, I forgot to remind you… for me, revenge is also part of the return.

'''Moriarty:''' I wonder if…

'''Moriarty:''' <span style="color:#e13838;">You</span> would still be surprised by what I’ve prepared for the next stage.

'''Moriarty:''' Huh?

'''Moriarty:''' …!

--

====<u>Gameplay 41-18 - Descended God</u>====
<nowiki>*</nowiki>splash*

Fu Hua closed her eyes unconsciously the moment she fell into the water.

But just a moment later, what came to her wasn’t the suffocating pressure of the water.

Fu Hua opened her eyes and found herself in a familiar and vacant space.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' The Ark?

'''Fu Hua:''' No, according to Moriarty, as a projection, I should have been sent somewhere outside this world… perhaps the gaps between reality and higher-dimensional spaces.

'''Fu Hua:''' Anyway, I should look around.

…

…

…

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

After the adventure in the forbidden area, Fu Hua expected the energy masses of similar natures could give her some special intel that couldn’t be obtained through recon.

But the condensate before her eyes had nothing within. Long years of experience using Fenghuang Down had enabled her to tell whether an object contained human memories…

But such a hollow existence was well beyond her experience.

'''Fu Hua:''' (I should look for more clues.)

''“...”''

Different from the hollow space earlier, this memory was filled with numerous noisy ideas.

''“A dangerous being from a dangerous world.”''

''“What matters is my thinking, not his.”''

''“Representative, dispose of this exhibit when you have time.”''

''“It doesn’t matter. It’s only an exhibit.”''

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' (What is the source of these ideas?)

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' They’re not thoughts, but notes…

<tabber>
|-|Notes=
Eleven and twelve neighbor each other.

Minutes fall on both shores of the clock.

The sacred earth of dawn and dusk.

The proud steel sail.

The sound of tide nears.

The transient life has gone away.

When the stars sink into the depths of the ocean, The great bird will call her name.
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
</tabber>
'''Fu Hua:''' What’s this?

'''Fu Hua:''' (From when I came to Phosphorus and till I found the Ark and Griseo… Whoever wrote the note seems to know very well what I went through here.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Sending messages in such a discreet way… was it to avoid the risk of getting found?)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Thinking back, when I was still on Earth, the mysterious being never showed themselves. They led me here by guiding my mind.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (And judging from the word choices…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (There seems to be nothing new…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Griseo… How am I supposed to return to reality?)

'''???:''' Do you need my help?

'''???:'''Fate seems to bind us together.

'''Fu Hua:''' This voice… Vi?

'''Vi (?):''' Bingo!

'''Vi (?):''' The original representative of Phosphorus, the witness to the cycle of worlds, the organiser of the museum… that’s too many titles. Since we’re here talking face-to-face, just call me Vita.

'''Fu Hua:''' I saw the photo taken by Cyan, but considering what you said and did as Vi, I probably cannot simply trust you because you’re their big sister.

'''Vita:''' Hmm, makes sense. But it is exactly because our previous exchanges didn’t go perfectly well that we got to face each other in person.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Vita:''' After all, if you did heed my key instructions and cut off the power of the Artifact, Moriarty wouldn’t have been a threat, and your projection would have vanished first from Phosphorus.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' The Artifact? Not the museum?

'''Vita:''' Ah, I see. You thought Moriarty was a projected exhibit in the museum, and cutting off the museum’s power like Red did would disable Moriarty?

'''Vita:''' It was the correct call, until Moriarty activated the Paradise Wardens.

'''Vita:''' But in Phosphorus’ way, the access to the Paradise Wardens is more closely connected to the Artifact than the access to the museum.

'''Vita:''' You got to know about the museum from Cyan, right? Sorry, they didn’t know the Artifact well enough and thus misinformed you.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Why didn’t you tell me before?

'''Vita:''' I’m just selfish like that.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Vita:''' Uh, you need me to be specific?

'''Vita:''' For someone like me who only cares about their own interests, altruistic people like you and Seele can actually be hard to deal with.

'''Fu Hua:''' You know Seele?

'''Vita:''' Yeah, but that’s another story in the Sea of Quanta… totally irrelevant to the crisis at hand.

'''Vita:''' Why are there projections in this world like you and Moriarty? What is the history of Phosphorus and Hesperus like? Griseo’s Ark, the fabled Creator of the world… how are they connected?

'''Vita:''' These concern the crisis we’re faced with, and I can give you the answers. After all…

'''Vita:''' You can say this place is my hometown.

'''Vita:''' So, where should we start?

'''Fu Hua:''' …

<tabber>
|-|[CHOICE] - What’s the deal with projections?=
'''Vita:''' About that…

'''Vita:''' You know we’re on the edge of the solar system, right?

'''Fu Hua:''' 4,500 astronomical units from the sun.

'''Vita:''' Astronomical units? Ah, the distance between your Earth and the sun? Hmm, something like that.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Vita:''' Just a difference in measurement. Anyway, because it’s too far away from the sun, the ecosystem here is more like the Sea of Quanta than the proper world. As for the projections…

'''Vita:''' The ones in the museum come from the Sea of Quanta, while Moriarty is a replicate from the proper world. And you, Fu Hua, are a mystery.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Vita:''' Seems you’re not very surprised. Good thing, though. Proof that I’m not lying to you, maybe?

'''Fu Hua:''' Moriarty seems to be looking for you. To be exact, he’s looking for someone with a concrete form but won’t show up easily before him. Is it you?

'''Vita:''' Is that right? He’s smarter than he looks.

'''Vita:''' As I said, I’m one of the curators of the museum. All exhibits, including Moriarty, were selected by me personally. Maybe this is a painful thing for him.

Vita added this flippantly, as if she was talking about a novel item with no particular value instead of an evil genius who just turned Phosphorus upside down.

Somewhat, Fu Hua recalled Moriarty’s disdainful look back in the museum, and something she heard after plunging into the cascade.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' When we first met, you tried to rob my body, my projection. Was there a reason why you couldn’t show up in Phosphorus in your own form?

'''Vita:''' Yeah, and this has something to do with our Creator.

'''Fu Hua:''' …
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
|-|[CHOICE] - What’s the truth about the history?=
'''Vita:''' You mean the connection between Phosphorus and Hesperus?

'''Fu Hua:''' Moriarty said there was an apocalyptic flood in Hesperus. What was it?
'''Vita:''' Just as you said.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Vita:''' The world became filthy, so the Creator imposed divine sanction to cleanse everything with the flood… sparing only the creatures in the Ark.

'''Fu Hua:''' …I’m not discussing ancient texts with you.

'''Vita:''' But it did happen, eight times. The current Phosphorus is the ninth one.
'''Fu Hua:''' …?!

'''Vita:''' Surprised? In simple terms…

'''Vita:''' Our homeland is just like a comet. Without the Creator, this is no more than a dirty snowball on the edge of the solar system. The snowball melts and causes a flood. Simple as that.

'''Fu Hua:''' But it doesn’t snow in Phosphorus.

'''Vita:''' Yeah, because all the water is usually kept underground. The conduit linking the Sea of Quanta, the true form of the Creator… they’re all down there. When the apocalypse happens, everything erupts like lava in a volcano.

'''Vita:''' Bang.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Wait, so the Vitas’ memories…

'''Vita:''' Yeah, also the work of the Creator.

'''Fu Hua:''' …
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
|-|[CHOICE] - Who is the Creator?=
'''Vita:''' It’s me.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Vita:''' Ha, just joking. After all, I’m a replica of her, and the Vitas you saw are my replicates.

'''Vita:''' We once lived together happily, until one day, I disobeyed the Creator’s order and ended up being sealed here.

'''Fu Hua:''' It sounds clumsy even for a freshly invented story.

'''Fu Hua:''' And even if you did seize my body, you’d only confuse the little Vitas.

'''Vita:''' Oh, it’s not what you think. What I tried to take from you was not the projection itself, but the channel or the pathway, which means if it worked, I’d return to Phosphorus in my own form instead of replacing you.

'''Vita:''' Of course, if it did happen, you would probably have ended up back on Earth and missed the opportunity to see Griseo.

'''Fu Hua:''' And you just planned on waltzing back to Phosphorus? Won’t the Creator be irritated?

'''Vita:''' You can say that She has stretched too thin, maybe. Without using Her ability as the representative, there’s no way She can find me.

'''Fu Hua:''' What about the Artifact? A magical item the Creator gave Phosphorus?

'''Vita:''' …

'''Vita:''' …

The talkative representative suddenly fell silent.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Vita:''' Oh, I’m just pondering on the words.

'''Vita:''' Simply put, it’s just a controller for the Paradise Wardens. Even the previous disused Artifacts can do the same. Hmm, this is probably the source of Moriarty’s power.

'''Vita:''' But unlike the disused ones, the one in the newest Phosphorus center, the only complete and intact one… has the power to summon the Creator.

'''Vita:''' …

'''Vita:''' I wouldn’t dwell on this topic… we’re too close to Phosphorus. Though She has stretched thin, if we talk about Her all the time or keep doing things She doesn’t approve of, we might still be found.

'''Vita:''' Right now, that’s all you need to know.

'''Vita:''' Off the topic, do you know why Cyan stumbles from time to time? Because of all the Vitas, he’s the one that bears the least resemblance to the Creator.

'''Fu Hua:''' …
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
|-|[CHOICE] - Where are we now?=
'''Vita:''' You mean this space?

'''Vita:''' I once gave it a name, the Path of the Fairy, but in an unromantic way, it’s just a narrow trail cleared out on purpose in the Sea of Quanta.

'''Fu Hua:''' So… just like how Moriarty chose Reichenbach in the first place?

'''Vita:''' …?

'''Vita:''' Reichenbach? The name of a band?

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' If you don’t know of the Reichenbach Falls, how did you turn Moriarty into an exhibit in the museum?

'''Vita:''' I picked him up in the Sea of Quanta. I just came back from a trip and needed a souvenir… what could be more suitable than a living sample? Besides, he was struggling to live, and making a projection became easy. He also looks good, by the way.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Vita:''' Relax. You were trapped here before, but you’ve got me. I mean to help my little siblings, and you mean to help Griseo. We share the same motivation and destination.

'''Vita:''' Really. Fight by my side, and you won’t regret it!

'''Fu Hua:''' …
<div style="line-height: 15px></div>
</tabber>
'''Fu Hua:''' …

<tabber>
|-|[CHOICE] - One last question.=
<div style="line-height: 15px></div><br>
</tabber>

'''Fu Hua:''' I have one last question: How can I make sure you’ve told me the truth?

'''Vita:''' Uh, that’s a good question. Of course…

'''Vita:''' I have no proof.

'''Vita:''' Maybe I have genuine intentions to work with you, or maybe I’m just driven by a whim to tease you, or I simply covet something you have and plan to take it from you.

'''Vita:''' In any case, you can’t tell, and there’s no point finding out. The bottom line is, you need to get out of here more than me. I need your help though, to get back to Phosphorus.

'''Vita:''' Isn’t it just a wonderful coincidence? Don’t you find it enticing?

While speaking, she reached out her hand.

'''Vita:''' Come on, what do you say?

'''Vita:''' I just found a rare opportunity to get out. Miss it and you’ll waste a few days more here.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Understood.

'''Vita:''' Good! I like working with decisive people.

'''Vita:''' Now that you share my vision, can you see it clearly?

'''Fu Hua:''' That’s…

'''Vita:''' An unusual bug. Lucky you! Just while we were chatting, some unknown change in the Path of the Fairy brought this obvious bug right under our noses!

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Vita:''' Quick, start acting~ We can only get out of here after taking care of this bug.

'''Fu Hua:''' Sorry, I’ve learned the truth about this so-called bug.

'''Fu Hua:''' Putting a mysterious veil on something already there to trick someone into trusting you. Is that what you’re all about?

'''Vita:''' Ah, it’s a special case that requires special treatment. The last time I saw you in the forbidden area, your projection was still in the real world, so finding the bridge to the real world was the only thing needed to get out of here.

'''Vita:''' Back then, I had no choice but to lie to you so that you wouldn’t ditch me.

'''Fu Hua:''' You seem to be proud of what you did.

'''Vita:''' Of course. I made you believe, and that was an achievement.

'''Vita:''' But you can also be proud of yourself. You walked into my trap and got out. That’s rare.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' (She is certainly shameless.)

But this time, was she showing her true face, or just pulling a trick again?

'''Vita:''' Anyway, this time, because you fell right onto the Path of the Fairy, you need to rip open a crack in the space yourself to get out of here.

'''Vita:''' The crack’s position and shape are decided randomly by the space itself, so that’s why it could be this way, a monster from the Sea of Quanta.

'''Vita:''' Just relax. You’re my ride this time, and I have no need to trick you.

'''Vita:''' …

'''Vita:''' Alright, deal with it.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Vita:''' What’s on your mind?

'''Fu Hua:''' I thought we’d fight the enemy together.

'''Vita:''' Oh, that won’t do. I’m quite frail and can’t do it. Did you forget? I’m still sealed by the Creator.

'''Vita:''' If I get hurt and can’t bring you back to your world, that would be a huge loss for you.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' …Never mind.

'''Vita:''' Wow! What a display. You know, I met another skilled fighter like you just the other day.

'''Vita:''' Alright! Can you go faster? Phosphorus is waiting for us!

'''Fu Hua:''' If you’re not contributing, you should just keep quiet.

'''Vita:''' But it’s not like I have anything better to do.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Vita:''' Well done!

'''Vita:''' Home we go!

'''Fu Hua:''' …!

'''Fu Hua:''' We did come back.

'''Fu Hua:''' Alright, Vita. I need to confirm Griseo’s situation, and you obviously care more about the little Vitas. Time for us to part ways.

'''Vita:''' No way! I just helped you. How can you be so cold?

Vita’s voice sounded near her, but Fu Hua didn’t see her around.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' Vita? Where are you?

'''Vita:''' In your pocket.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

Fu Hua felt her pocket. Nothing but the gift from Orange.

'''Vita:''' That’s right!

Looking at the talking candy, Fu Hua didn’t know what to feel.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Vita:''' Orange gave you this, right? She’s a gentle kid.

'''Fu Hua:''' But why did you have to assume this form?

'''Vita:''' Don’t you think it’s way cuter than the broken camera?

'''Fu Hua:''' Your body can’t maintain its normal shape?

'''Vita:''' I’m only a projection after all, and I came here hitchhiking. I can’t use any of the representative permissions, nor do I dare.

'''Vita:''' I told you. I’m just a pure and frail girl.

'''Vita:''' Don’t ditch me for being weak.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Alright, but you have to listen to me.

====<u>Gameplay 41-19 - Sins and Evil</u>====
A while later…

'''Vita:''' Great! Now that we’ve nothing to worry about, it’s time to give Moriarty a bit of pressure.

'''Vita:''' If I were him, I’d be studying the Ark in the forbidden area. After all, it’s the origin of Phosphorus and the key to all the questions he’s curious about. Right, speaking of the Ark, it came from your Earth.

'''Vita:''' In a way, we’re all your students!

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Vita:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' Nothing. I just found you too modest.

'''Vita:''' I’ve always been modest! I’ll take that as a compliment.

'''Vita:''' That’s right, this way please~

'''???:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' Strange… a neutral Imaginary Construct… What’s it doing here?

'''Vita:''' Hmm, this is a rare monster. Let’s add it to our exhibits later!

'''Fu Hua:''' Not until you fix your last exhibit.

'''Fu Hua:''' Honkai beasts… have appeared again.

'''Fu Hua:''' Honkai beasts in the city again… more Honkai events here now.

'''Vita:''' Not necessarily. Since Moriarty is purging the Honkai right now, there has to be a few exceptions.

'''Fu Hua:''' You’ve been watching this place all along. Are you saying he left these Honkai beasts behind on purpose?

'''Vita:''' Have you heard of a way to raise animals which keeps a few of their enemies in their habitat so that they stay alert all the time?

'''Vita:''' Besides, Moriarty’s plan is not to end the disaster here. He needs a dynamic balance between the Honkai and the representatives. Only in this way can he…

'''Vita:''' But he has underestimated the complexity of all this. Will everything all go according to his plan?

'''Vita:''' Alright, let’s go.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' (Vita’s attitude seems to be different from before.)

'''Fu Hua:''' The projection has become less stable… What exactly is going on?

'''Vita:''' That’s because the projected passage is for one person. It’s not supposed to hold us both.

'''Vita:''' It’s a special situation. Try to get used to it.

'''Fu Hua:''' So this is your work. I’m guessing the previous instances were caused by your observing this place through me?

'''Vita:''' I’m not telling you~

'''Fu Hua:''' Have the Paradise Wardens grown stronger? Or rather, has my projection become weaker because of you?

'''Vita:''' Ah, I didn’t expect them to be such an annoyance. I should have limited their number had I known better.

'''Fu Hua:''' You can control these monsters?

'''Vita:''' Of course not. These guys are part of the city, and they’re only put to use under certain circumstances… like janitors.

'''Vita:''' You saw disturbances in Red’s memory, and that’s because Moriarty took over their access permissions and caused the disturbances.

'''Vita:''' As I said… they’re my copies and they share some of the characteristics with projections. They’re still unlike you or Moriarty, though.

'''Fu Hua:''' So are these memories real? They only forgot the present?

Vita replied with an enigmatic smile. Just when she tried to add something, an unexpected voice cut in.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Miss Vita?

'''Vita:''' Hi, have you missed me?

'''Fu Hua:''' Red and Purple…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Miss Vita, stay away from the outsider! She’s dangerous!

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Wait, Red. Miss Vita doesn’t seem quite herself.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Miss Vita, why are you here? Did you notice the anomalies in Phosphorus and come to help us?

'''Vita:''' Yeah, I came to help, but…

'''Vita:''' It’s not exactly what you think.

'''Vita:''' I came back to deal with Moriarty.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Miss Vita, is there a misunderstanding? Moriarty does have his own agenda, but he did bring us a solution to end the disaster…

'''Vita:''' You mean the Paradise Wardens behind you? Unfortunately, they’re now my target.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …?

'''Vita:''' Ah, innocent kids. Did it occur to you that using power you cannot control can seriously backfire?

'''Vita:''' How can you be sure that Moriarty’s target is not you?

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Miss Vita, Moriarty is not like that… He’s genuinely helping us to fight the Honkai beasts.

'''Vita:''' You…

'''Vita:''' I see… Just like fledglings, in your subconsciousness, if someone shows you friendly gestures, then they can’t be a bad guy…

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Miss Vita! How can you say that!

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' We don’t have a choice, and if necessary… we’ll turn to the last resort.

As he spoke, he touched the key on his chest unconsciously.

'''Vita:''' You probably don’t know how the Artifact works, but…

'''Vita:''' …

'''Vita:''' I can see you’re not ready to budge. Well then, there’s no point in talking anymore.

'''Vita:''' Make way. We’re going after Moriarty, and you can’t stop Fu Hua.

'''<span style="color:#8251c2;">Harmonious Vita:</span>''' Miss Vita, do we really have to come to this?

'''Vita:''' …

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Miss Vita!

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …I see.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Come through, Miss Vita and Fu Hua.

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' …?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Miss Vita is right. We can’t put all our faith in Moriarty, so…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Making sure the Artifact can be activated is our top priority.

'''Vita:''' …

'''Vita:''' …Never mind.

'''Vita:''' Okay, let’s go.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''<span style="color:#d65252;">Righteous Vita:</span>''' Miss Vita…

'''Vita:''' Say hello to Encompassing, Veracious, Disciplined, and Erudite for me.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Vita:''' I heard your friend designed and built this ship?

'''Fu Hua:''' So you knew.

'''Vita:''' I’ve looked at the records left behind by the Ark. What I’m truly curious about is…

'''Vita:''' How does it feel… having lived tens of thousands of years?

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' To be honest, it doesn’t feel like anything.

'''Vita:''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' It’s pointless on its own.

'''Fu Hua:''' Every day is new, and all the yesterdays have left their marks on my life. I don’t have to reflect on them intentionally.

'''Vita:''' You care so little about your life?

'''Fu Hua:''' Of course not, it’s just… hmm. To someone that doesn’t know me well, that’s how it’ll seem.

'''Fu Hua:''' After all, the purpose of life… doesn’t concern the past, or the future, or the existence of anything… the only thing that matters is whether I can live in the present with a peaceful mind.

'''Vita:''' Well… what if you’re a hopeless bad guy?

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Vita:''' Think about it. If your purpose has nothing to do with anything, no one can stop you when you mean to do something bad, right?

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' It was once a possibility, but not now.

'''Vita:''' Because you made special friends whose lives were just as long as yours and whose power could also match yours?

'''Fu Hua:''' You know everything. Why ask?

'''Vita:''' Yeah, I can imagine.

'''Vita:''' (Only… that’s not my style…)

'''Vita:''' Let’s go see that Moriarty.

'''Vita:''' Yes, drive your fist into his fake smile, let me see him soaked in his own tears. It’ll be a sight!

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' …Moriarty.

Standing before the gate of the forbidden area, Moriarty stared at the huge Ark standing tall, as if a gardener watching her garden.

He turned around on hearing the footsteps. After identifying the visitors, he wore a surprised look, which then turned into a smile and a nod at Fu Hua.

'''Moriarty:''' Hmm, the great detective came back, of course.

'''Moriarty:''' But you shouldn’t have. This is the crime scene, the grand show before the climax. You came prematurely for the stage. I’ve just swept it clean.

'''???:''' The stage? A pretty doll in the display case thinks he’s good enough to be a director just because he’s observed a few visitors?

Moriarty didn’t speak. He stared at Vita with overflowing emotions in his eyes.

'''Vita:''' Long time no see~ It’s my first time talking to an exhibit. Surprise for you, right? Or have you forgotten who I am?

'''Moriarty:''' Forgotten? How could I?

'''Moriarty:''' I’ve been struggling to wipe your disgusting face from my mind for every second since you took me here.

'''Moriarty:''' And even that is a huge understatement. To be more precise, allow me to reference the Ark for an analogy.

'''Moriarty:''' Suppose during the millennial journey of the Ark, our beautiful painter has to stay awake forever… what would she have turned into?

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Moriarty:''' The universe is a great void billions of times more expansive than an ocean. You put someone into it, they’d be subjected to solitude that’s harsher than death.

'''Moriarty:''' And if you convert the infinity of space into that of time…

'''Moriarty:''' Then you begin to know how it feels to be a pretty doll in the display case.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' The exhibits in the museum are still conscious?

'''Vita:''' That can’t be helped. They’re projections, after all. Shutting down their minds would only make them perish in the display case. Besides, when I first saw him, he was dissolving in the Sea of Quanta and crying for help at me!

'''Vita:''' I’m the one who freed you from your ill fate and gave you a second life. In the end, you repay me with hate and disdain?

'''Vita:''' If I knew you hated your life so much… I would’ve let you rot and spared myself the trouble.

'''Fu Hua:''' Vita, you…

'''Moriarty:''' See? In her eyes, mortals are worthless. I can only hurt her “family” to make her feel pain.

'''Moriarty:''' Elegant, passionate, a bit rash but always well liked? My old friend, take a look at her. Do you see a shred of elegance or passion?

'''Vita:''' Huh? Guess you’ve never seen a girl being mad. How I pity you. I always stay true to myself unapologetically. That’s me.

'''Vita:''' Oh, wait, come to think about it, I did mistreat you once.

'''Moriarty:''' …?

'''Vita:''' Sorry, I was bust working and forgot that.

'''Vita:''' After so many years, have I given you a name?

'''Moriarty:''' You…

'''Moriarty:''' Moriarty! My name is Moriarty!

'''Vita:''' Ah, Moriarty. Just as before. I guess it works.

'''Vita:''' If I knew you could stir up so much trouble… I should’ve placed you in an even bigger display case.

'''Moriarty:''' …You!

'''Moriarty:''' Humph. Talk all you want behind the great detective.

'''Moriarty:''' The show is about to reach its climax. You’ll learn soon enough who is the clown on the stage.

'''Vita:''' Really? It’s alright. I love a good show no matter who’s on stage. Only…

'''Vita:''' I don’t see even one actor or actress I like on stage. You’re not referring to my replicates, are you?

'''Moriarty:''' …

'''Moriarty:''' Hahahahaha!

'''Vita:''' …What’s so funny?

'''Moriarty:''' What you just said… do you really think so?

'''Moriarty:''' As far as I know… to truly know someone, you don’t listen to what they have said. Instead, you listen to what they have not said.

'''Moriarty:''' So, did you really fail to see the paradox?

'''Moriarty:''' When I sent your family onto the stage… you did show up in front of me.

'''Vita:''' Is this the climax you prepared for us? It’s very trite, to be honest…

'''Moriarty:''' Trite?

'''Moriarty:''' No matter, you will soon be pleased with this play.

…

'''Vita:''' Can you give me a break? You talk about them all the time and I… Fu Hua is getting sick. Right, Fu Hua?

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Moriarty:''' For a magnum opus, proper warmup is necessary.

'''Moriarty:''' But the time has almost come. I believe you’d be able to appreciate the climax of the show very soon.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Moriarty:''' Nothing… I’m only restoring the original functions of these not-so-handy toys.

'''Fu Hua:''' What? Were the Paradise Wardens not designed to protect Phosphorus?

'''Vita:''' …

'''Moriarty:''' Protect Phosphorus? Indeed. But after you broke into the forbidden area and enabled me to take over them through the remaining nexus of the old Artifact, I found a very interesting feature module.

'''Moriarty:''' “Annihilate all living organisms indiscriminately.”

'''Vita:''' You mean to activate the sweep feature?

'''Moriarty:''' As a matter of fact, it was already turned on… precisely the moment when they attacked you. Which is to say, I’m not controlling them to attack you. They’re just attacking everyone indiscriminately.

'''Moriarty:''' Well, when we set our eyes on Phosphorus…

'''Moriarty:''' When the trusted assistants suddenly attack, how will our dear representatives feel? Surprised? Pained? Incredulous?

'''Moriarty:''' Ah, such a shame I can’t see it in person.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Vita:''' …

Moriarty observed the reactions of the two and smiled with satisfaction.

'''Moriarty:''' Of course, judging from your reaction, just like I assumed, the Artifact would make things very interesting after being activated.

'''Moriarty:''' Oh, I’m dying to find out.

'''Fu Hua:''' Sorry to disappoint you.

'''Moriarty:''' …?

…

''[CG plays wherein Griseo appears, having taken down several Paradise Wardens.'']

'''Vita:''' (Oh.)

'''Fu Hua:''' You came right on time, Griseo.

'''Griseo:''' Sorry, patrolling the city and making sure there were no monsters left took longer than I expected…

'''Griseo:''' Hua, I hope I didn’t come too late.

--

====<u>Gameplay 41-20 - Another Return</u>====
The museum, some time ago, when Fu Hua and Vita were trapped on the Path of the Fairy.

'''Griseo:''' …

Looking at the last monster fading away, Griseo was lost in thought.

Not long ago, as a result of Fu Hua operating the console, she woke up from the malfunctioning dormancy capsule, which disrupted Moriarty’s plan.

That said, it was Griseo herself who was trapped in the museum.

'''Griseo:''' That’s unexpected… He used these monsters as cover to cut off the museum’s power while running away.

'''Griseo:''' Hua!

She wasn’t there to see it, but she knew Fu Hua had risked everything fighting with the projection to save her.

'''Griseo:''' At this point we can only reinvestigate.

'''Griseo:''' Yes… There is Hua’s color here.

'''Griseo:''' But, if she fell from here…

'''Griseo:''' No, I’m sure Hua will find a way.

'''Griseo:''' …That’s right. I should find what I can do too.

'''Griseo:''' This color… Is it the person that locked me up?

'''Griseo:''' The color extends to…

'''Griseo:''' Hmm? Does he enjoy standing in the display case?

'''Griseo:''' What an unusual person.

'''Griseo:''' What a beautiful feather. Its color reminds me of the Vitas.

'''Griseo:''' Hmm? This is… the Ark’s fragment? But its colors are completely unlike the Ark… it’s more like the previous monsters…

'''Griseo:''' That’s the exit… It won’t open? Is it because I don’t have permission?

'''Griseo:''' A controller similar to a number lock… Looks like I have to crack it from the inside.

Griseo took out her toolkit. It was a departing gift from Vill-V when the Ark first set sail.

“The Most Advanced Engineering Equipment: SOP Compiled by the Greatest Engineer of the Century Who’s Dedicated Half of Her Life to This Book”... Vill-V said this when handing over the kit and then added something:

'''“Expert” Vill-V:''' It’s alright if you can’t understand it or you simply aren’t interested. Just put it aside. It’s going to be lost anyway. Just something to keep you distracted during the journey.

But she read it later anyway. Maybe it was because Vill-V found the Flame-Chasers to make an audiobook of it, or maybe the space journey was too long.

Anyway, in the third decade of the Ark’s second journey, she became a capable engineer who could make small pieces of equipment and replace Ark components on her own without the smart assistant.

Just like her mother once could.

Only, dissembling and analysing a controller made by someone else… that was a first for her.

'''Griseo:''' Huh?

Just when Griseo was carefully operating the detection machine to restore the inner structure of the controller, something dawned on her.

'''Griseo:''' The structure… is the one used in the Sanctuary…

'''Griseo:''' Is it Ark tech?

She then made an even more pleasant finding… the controller wasn’t broken. It was simply out of power.

'''Griseo:''' …Just connect it to a compatible power source and the gate can be opened?

'''Griseo:''' I need to look around for usable energy.

'''Griseo:''' The cabinet is empty, but it’s radiating a mess of colors… similar to how that fragment made me feel.

'''Griseo:''' Did the owner of this color leave the Ark here?

'''Griseo:''' I seem to have seen the same color… very complex, yet familiar and dangerous at the same time.

'''Griseo:''' Like the color left by many people and many other things.

'''Griseo:''' …Like the Earth fifty thousand years ago when I last saw it.

'''Griseo:''' But that was long ago. Back then, the Ark had just set sail. Has this museum been here for this long? Or, the owner of the museum…

“Brief words from a strange land to a visitor.” The museum’s owner seems to have gone on space journeys too.

Griseo used the machine to examine the soil sample in the showcase… and what she found was a disappointment.

'''Griseo:''' No. There’s residual energy, but too little to extract… or compare…

'''Griseo:''' Better take a look at other exhibits.

'''Griseo:''' This exhibit… is pure energy!

'''Griseo:''' It looks extractable. I’ll try.

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' Ah, I didn’t control well…

'''Griseo:''' The energy… has faded away here.

'''Griseo:''' …?

'''Griseo:''' …A new color?

'''Griseo:''' Ah, a reflection…

'''???:''' Come on, what do you say?

'''???:''' I just found a rare opportunity to get out. Miss it and you’ll waste a few days more here.

'''???:''' Understood.

'''Griseo:''' That last voice… it was Hua’s!

'''Griseo:''' So the energy went Hua’s way?

'''Griseo:''' (Huh? So… the waterfall itself…)

'''Griseo:''' …

'''Griseo:''' Mobius said that, on Earth, we could exchange energy through the Eye of the Deep and the Sea of Quanta.

'''Griseo:''' Then… is the waterfall… Phosphorus’ Eye of the Deep?

'''???:''' Uh… now it’s my turn to read?

'''???:''' Ahem, “The Most Advanced Engineering Equipment: SOP Compiled by the Greatest Engineer of the Century Who’s Dedicated Half of Her Life to This Book”, Vol. 15. Read by Pardofelis.

'''Pardofelis:''' “Normally, the massive, infinite data in the Sea of Quanta shows different states of unity when folded by different dimensions. Thus, it can be viewed as an ocean of data. To extract…”

All 42 volumes of “The Most Advanced Engineering Equipment: SOP Compiled by the Greatest Engineer of the Century Who’s Dedicated Half of Her Life to This Book” spread out like a web in Griseo’s mind.

She methodically pieced the Honkai energy micro extractor together. For this common resource in higher-dimensional spaces, the extraction knowledge was of course compiled into Vill-V’s voiced manual.

The action, or experiment, required twenty minutes in a quiet environment. Obviously, it couldn’t be used on the battlefield, but for someone trying to break free, it was an ecstasy.

'''Griseo:''' …Hmm, almost done.

'''Griseo:''' Next, use the energy to drive…

…

…!

'''Griseo:''' …It worked.

…

The instant she pushed open the door, her body became enveloped in blinding white light.

'''Griseo:''' (Huh? The space behind the gate seems to be…)

Back to the present time…

'''Moriarty:''' Looks like you’ve matched me every step of the way.

'''Moriarty:''' In the museum, you, the great detective, pretended to be weak while trying to find a way to cut off the museum’s power. My waterfall trap did work, but you managed to cut off the dormancy capsule’s running power.

'''Moriarty:''' Then, after waking up, the painter lady challenged me and forced me to cut off the power of the entire museum to lock her in the cage built for me.

'''Moriarty:''' After that, she reactivated the museum in a way unknown to me and stayed in Phosphorus, so that the Paradise Warden mutiny caused no substantial damage.

'''Vita:''' I can’t say you’re wrong.

'''Fu Hua:''' I’ve fought you many times and I know what I’m up against. It’s always better to have more cards in your hand.

'''Moriarty:''' Good planning, acting, and a lot of luck got you here. You truly are my one and only opponent, the real Holmes.

Fu Hua shook her head.

'''Fu Hua:''' Without the camera Cyan left me, I had no way to know how the museum’s power system worked.

'''Fu Hua:''' And if you weren’t overly confident in your plan and you didn’t allow Blue and the others to act freely, you wouldn’t have missed the important clues.

'''Fu Hua:''' You didn’t lose to me. You lost to your pride and conceit.

'''Moriarty:''' …

'''Moriarty:''' Hahahahaha!

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''Moriarty:''' You won an insignificant battle and now you’re making your victory speech for the war?

'''Moriarty:''' My dear detective, you stayed retired for too long and have become rusty.

'''Moriarty:''' You think stopping the Honkai beasts and the Paradise Wardens will end the chaos in Phosphorus?

'''Moriarty:''' No no no. It’s only just begun.

'''Griseo:''' Huh?

'''Vita:''' …Oh.

'''Fu Hua:''' Vita, do you know something?

'''Moriarty:''' Of course she does.

'''Moriarty:''' But…

'''Moriarty:''' My dear detective, have you never wondered why the little representatives would believe I could easily make the Honkai go away from the city? Where has all the Honkai energy gone?

'''Moriarty:''' And, dear painter lady, has it occurred to you that if the Ark has crashed…

'''Moriarty:''' How much pollution its mega-power Honkai energy engine would cause?

'''Griseo:''' Ah….

…

The next second, a strange sound that haunted the dreams of everyone present came from the city far away.

'''Moriarty:''' What choice do you think the little representatives would make when the real catastrophe befalls?

'''Vita:''' …

Of course she knew the answer.

It was a scene that played over and over again in her head.

''[CG plays wherein the sky darkens rapidly, and what appears to be a giant rift forms within it:''

'''''Griseo:''' What… is that…'']

'''Vita:''' Oh my.

'''Vita:''' What’s that?

'''Vita:''' Of course I know.

'''Vita:''' What else can it be?

'''Vita:''' The Creator of Phosphorus, the destroyer of Hesperus, the usurper of the Ark, the manipulator of dwarf planets, the Abyss of the Sea of Quanta…

'''Vita:''' Who else can it be, if not <span style=”color:#e13838;”>Sa</span>?

===Side Stories===

===Side Story - Secret in the Painting===

====<u>Scribble and Scrawl</u>====
This happened when Fu Hua first came here…

A warm and bright afternoon. Everything was in perfect tranquility.

A small one with a sad look was passing through the street crowds.

'''Fu Hua:''' Cyan?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Fu Hua! Sorry, I didn’t see you… uh…

The photos in Cyan’s arms scattered onto the ground when he was taken aback. Fu Hua bent down to help him pick them up, which only made him more uneasy.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Sorry… sorry… I… I…

Trying to spare him the embarrassment, Fu Hua started a new topic.

'''Fu Hua:''' Cyan, are these photos… today’s records?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Oh… yeah. I’m getting feedback that Honkai beasts have been spotted in Qiming, so I’ll carefully log the city details for archiving and comparing.

All photos were time-stamped, but some had a circle mark.

'''Fu Hua:''' What’s wrong with these photos? You seem to have marked them in a special way.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Yes, there’s something that caught my attention. Someone is making strange graffiti on the walls.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Purple helps me to wipe it off, and I asked Orange to remind everyone too, but it still keeps showing up. Ah…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' It’s not going to hurt Qiming in any meaningful way, but…

The graffiti was smeared in some photos but not in others, so the work could be clearly made out…

A simple painting of irregular colored shapes, which formed a pattern that resembled a sunflower.

'''Fu Hua:''' Is this a sunflower?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Ah, it’s a special pattern on a round platform in Changgeng.

'''Fu Hua:''' No wonder it looks familiar, but why would the graffiti maker keep repeating the floor tile pattern?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Not simply repeating it. Look here, Fu Hua.

'''Fu Hua:''' Footprints? A set of footprints on each of the floor tiles, and through comparison, I can see their position change in every photo. I thought it was…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Of course it wasn’t the citizens!

'''Fu Hua:''' Sorry, Cyan, let’s keep looking to see if there’s more graffiti today in Qiming.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Huh? You wish to help me investigate? Hmm, the nearest spot is…

By comparing the photos, Cyan pointed the way.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I remember seeing one there!

'''Fu Hua:''' Let’s go take a look.

The first spot. On the bright wall, there was a set of small footprints on the sunflower-patterned floor tile.

Cyan took a photo of the graffiti with his camera. Then, he began to observe it carefully.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' If the footprints point to the next spot… this way, Fu Hua!

'''Fu Hua:''' There’s Honkai beasts. Cyan, you should hide.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' F-Fu Hua, be careful!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' S-Sorry, Fu Hua, it’s all my fault…

'''Fu Hua:''' No, we had great teamwork. I wouldn’t have been able to focus on fighting if it weren’t for you showing the way.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Okay.

The second spot. On the broken wall, there was a set of small footprints on the sunflower-patterned floor tile.

Cyan took a photo of the graffiti with his camera. Then, he began to observe it carefully.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' The footprints are closer to the center of the pattern! Do they indicate both direction and distance?

'''Fu Hua:''' Your speculation should be correct. Maybe we’re closer to our destination.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' No no no, I didn’t know what I was saying…

'''Fu Hua:''' We’ll soon be able to verify it.

The third spot. On the freshly-painted wall, there was a set of small footprints on the sunflower-patterned floor tile.

Cyan took a photo of the graffiti with his camera. Then, he began to observe it carefully.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' The footprints are aligned with the center of the image, but…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …They are pointing toward nothing.

'''Fu Hua:''' What if this special brick image is referring to Changgeng?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Oh, in that case…

Cyan took out the photos he had taken during patrols. Although most of them were pictures of sunflowers, the one in Changgeng’s old plaza stood out.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' This graffiti can be found at every corner of Qiming. Even if we cover them, it’ll appear again, as if hoping that someone will understand and follow its guidance…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …And to draw graffiti associated with an evening star in a city named after a morning star, how conspicuous.

'''Fu Hua:''' It seems like that’s the artist’s intention. Let’s go to Changgeng and see what’s really going on.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Fu Hua, I’m not certain if I’m right…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …And Changgeng has been abandoned for too long. If you followed me there under the current circumstances, you might be dragged into trouble…

'''Fu Hua:''' That’s alright. I promised that I would help, and I can’t just leave those Honkai beasts to run free.

'''Fu Hua:''' You are doing your best to investigate this as a registrar, and I am doing it to find a way home. We are helping each other, there’s nothing to feel bad about.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' B-But…

'''Fu Hua:''' It’s alright, I’m just going to take a look. If we are thinking too much into it, it will actually be good news for Qiming.

With Fu Hua’s acknowledgement and consolation, Cyan blushed as he held his camera and photos tighter.

'''Fu Hua:''' Let’s go, Cyan. We’ll continue investigating in Changgeng.

Fu Hua gently patted him on the back, and this act gave him some encouragement and courage.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Alright!

--

====<u>Track Down the Truth</u>====
Following the graffiti’s guidance, the two entered Changgeng.

'''Fu Hua:''' If my hypothesis is true and the author is intentionally leading us to Changgeng, he must have left some clues behind.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Yeah, if only we could find them… N-No, in this situation, wouldn’t it be better if there was nothing to find at all? S-Sorry…

'''Fu Hua:''' Don’t think too much into it and focus on what we can do before us.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' A-Alright!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' F-Fu Hua, where is this place you talked about…?

'''Fu Hua:''' Follow me, I still remember this place.

'''Fu Hua:''' Changgeng has so many Honkai beasts wandering about…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I’ll report this situation to Red and Green. This is far too dangerous.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' This place is so desolate.

'''Fu Hua:''' It’s not far ahead.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' We found nothing. Fu Hua, did you find anything?

'''Fu Hua:''' (These obstacles are blocking my view, I need to <span style="color:#ffe14b;">observe closely</span>…)

'''Fu Hua:''' The olfactory trace left by paint… The graffiti should be just behind the crates, but which one?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' It’s really here!

The graffiti artist used plenty of colors, and wrote “near the round pavilion”.

Below that, there was also a string of numbers: 7, 2, 0, 7, 2, 0, 7, 2, 0, _.

'''Fu Hua:''' Pavilion… I remember that it’s some place in Qiming, but there are quite a few pavilions with round roofs in the city. And…

'''Fu Hua:''' …This empty space at the end of the numbers, what is it supposed to be?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …It should be 7.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' The numbers follow the sequence of “7, 2, 0”, so the number in the empty space should be 7.

'''Fu Hua:''' Yeah, I think so too, you have a keen eye.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Well maybe not, I might be wrong…

'''Fu Hua:''' Don’t deny yourself so quickly. Even if you end up changing your mind, you need to see the right evidence before doing so.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Yeah, that’s true!

'''Fu Hua:''' We don’t know what these numbers are for at the moment. Let’s jot it down and look around in Qiming.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Yeah!

====<u>Lone Responsibility</u>====
The two returned to Qiming, and looked at the passing crowds and rows of houses. They didn’t know where to start.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' There are so many houses and people… Ugh, where should we begin our investigation?

Cyan stood in the middle of the street and seemed helpless again. He did not notice Fu Hua observing him from the side.

'''Fu Hua:''' (I can now confirm that this isn’t a serious or dangerous incident. With Cyan’s capabilities, he can finish the investigation alone. He just needs to believe in himself.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Perhaps this is a good opportunity for him to build confidence and acknowledge himself…)

'''Fu Hua:''' (As the city’s representative, it will be a problem if he always doubts himself. If he doesn’t recognise his own competence, he will think that he is unworthy of taking on more responsibilities.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (After all, I was also once…)

'''Fu Hua:''' Cyan, I have an idea.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' W-What is it?

'''Fu Hua:''' We have too much to search through this time and it will be too conspicuous if we move together. How about we…

Fu Hua moved closer to the boy’s ear and told him her plan.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Huh? Me? Alone?

'''Fu Hua:''' Yes.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' T-This… I… Alone, I’m…

'''Fu Hua:''' Let’s go with this, remember to send messages to me. How I operate will depend on you.

Fu Hua waved her hand and left while Cyan was still confused.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Huh…?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Alright, I have to calm down and be rational…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Pretend that Fu Hua is still around! If I were with her, how would we analyse this?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' “Cyan, if the graffiti’s artist is afraid of his work being covered, then he will return to the scene to check… Perhaps we can find the place he wants us to go to through him.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' “He draws graffiti frequently, so his sleeves and pant legs must be stained with paint.”

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' “...The graffiti has vibrant colors and will leave obvious marks on his body.”

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Then, she would definitely say, “you’re right, Cyan.” Oh, I sound so arrogant!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' No, now’s not the time to think about that. Since Fu Hua believes in me, I’ve got to do my best!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Paint, paint… these passersby are dressed cleanly, so they’re innocent…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Huh? Wait, that passerby…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Found him! That child’s got paint on him!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' But I’m not 100% sure… I should follow him for now.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Is he going to graffiti again?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Oh, just taking a look…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' He's buying things…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Doesn’t look like paint, though… More like textbooks?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' A round pavilion surrounded by water… so it’s this place!

The little boy arrived at a building next to a pavilion and pushed the door open.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' He didn’t lock his door, as if to allow someone in.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …What should I do, should I go in and take a look?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Oh, he appeared again! I should check things out now!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Is this some kind of secret base?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I feel the owner of this place prefers reading to graffitiing!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' There are many books on training logical thinking… and some coloring books.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …His hobbies are quite diverse.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Many paints, brushes… and photos of graffitis!

The graffiti artist wrote in beautiful cursive: “the night illuminates the morning star.”

Below that, there was also a string of numbers: 12, 7, 5, 2, 3, -1, _.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Is this a hint that we’ll find something in Qiming at night?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' And… the empty space at the end of the numbers should be…

====<u>Traces and Hints</u>====
The entire city slept through the cloudy night.

'''Fu Hua:''' Now’s the perfect time, we probably can find what the artist wants us to see in the city.

'''Fu Hua:''' Now that I think about it, the graffiti artist may have used special paint that will stand out at night.

'''Fu Hua:''' And paint always has a sharp smell. Using that, perhaps we can find more clues… If we’re lucky, we may even chance upon paint marks left by the artist.

'''Fu Hua:''' …Let’s take a look around.

'''Fu Hua:''' It’s that stink again. Use Insight to <span style="color:#ffe14b;">see</span> it.

'''Fu Hua:''' Found it, this way.

'''Fu Hua:''' Can’t believe there’s paint spilled on the floor. Purple is going to have a hard time cleaning it.

'''Fu Hua:''' The clue is blocked off by a crate. There’s also paint on the crate, <span style="color:#a7a7a7;">is it possible that</span>…

'''Fu Hua:''' …As expected.

The graffiti artist used special paint to write in a trendy, artistic style. The words had a neon glow and stated: “The celebration remembers for us.”

Below that, there was also a string of numbers: 23, 16, 28, 11, 33, 6, 38, _.

'''Fu Hua:''' Celebration? Is it related to the artifact that Purple mentioned before? The photo collection that recorded every celebration in the city?

'''Fu Hua:''' And the number in the empty space is…

<tabber>
|-|[CHOICE] - 1=
'''Fu Hua:''' The answer is 1.

'''Fu Hua:''' The second, fourth, and sixth numbers each have a difference of 5.

'''Fu Hua:''' But, that shouldn’t be the case… Ever since Orange reprimanded the kids for their prank, it’s even less likely for the children to sneak into the museum.

'''Fu Hua:''' …First, let me send these discoveries to Cyan so that he can check them out.

====<u>Underlying Thread</u>====
'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Time to complete a mission without Fu Hua again.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' “You’re a clever and sharp-witted representative. You can overcome all obstacles and achieve everything with your own capabilities.”

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Mm, I feel… a little better now.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' There must be new clues waiting for me in the museum…

The boy encouraged himself quietly and began to search for any traces left behind by the graffiti artist.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Yeah, this is Purple’s postcard collection!

In the silent museum, there was only the sound of the boy flipping through books.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Purple’s photography skills are improving… The photos on the postcards look better over time…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …No, now’s not the time to be saying all this. I must find clues about the graffiti artist, I can’t let Fu Hua down!

Cyan resolved himself and began to focus.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I found it! Huh?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Purple took a photo of the children who drew the graffiti…

In the photo, two boys held up a paper board together and smiled at the camera, like the other residents.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' On the board was written… “the place we are all familiar with”.

Below that, there was also a string of numbers: 3, _, 29, 62, 127.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Although I don’t know what the words mean, the answer this time should be…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' How strange, this photo was from last year’s celebration… The puzzle from the graffiti artist lasted for so long? But the graffiti has only been appearing recently.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Very peculiar…

--

====<u>Clueless</u>====
Fu Hua and Cyan each made their own discoveries and discussed the last puzzle.

'''Fu Hua:''' “The place we are all familiar with”...?

'''Fu Hua:''' But right now, we only have four numbers: 7, 4, 1, 6.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …

Vita flipped through the photos from his bag in confusion, trying to find any clues from the pictures of buildings in the city on an ordinary day.

He looked through them for a long time, but ultimately placed them down in disappointment.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' *Sigh*

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I can’t do it after all…

'''Fu Hua:''' What makes you say that?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I’m not as smart as Blue, nor as strong as Red. Compared to Green, I’m only a child…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' The graffiti artist gave me all the clues, but I… I still…

The boy lowered his head, dejected.

'''Fu Hua:''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' (How should I comfort him?)

<tabber>

'''Fu Hua:''' Why don’t we start from the information we have on hand?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …?

'''Fu Hua:''' Let’s leave this string of strange numbers aside for now. Since it’s stated that this is a place that “we are all familiar with”, then…

'''Fu Hua:''' How about we take a look at the children’s secret base?

The dispirited boy forced himself to brighten up and nodded seriously.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Yeah, let’s go.

====<u>Disperse the Clouds</u>====
'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Sorry, Fu Hua…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I wasn’t helpful at all and, what’s worse, made you worry…

'''Fu Hua:''' Don’t say that, you’re just not used to this.

'''Fu Hua:''' Let me handle them!

'''Fu Hua:''' …I think someone’s inside.

The two opened a door and in that familiar house, a boy stared at them in shock.

The drawing tools on the table, the papers with graffiti designs scattered on the floor, and the paint that stained his hands. They all proved that he was the graffiti artist that had been defacing the corners of the city.

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' Cyan and… that woman over there… why are you here?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Uh… Because of your graffiti.

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' What’s wrong with graffiti? Don’t you like taking photos?

'''Fu Hua:''' How are those related?

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' They are both art. A new friend I made recently said that art is an expression of emotions… So, he encouraged me to do this, hoping that everyone can see my work along every street!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Huh? But…

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' You take photos because you like to, and I do graffiti because I miss my friend. I-Is that wrong?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' So that’s the reason.

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' Yes… Before he fell ill, we were very, very good friends! He was smarter than me and liked to solve various types of puzzles very, very much…

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' He picks up everything really quickly! Aside from art that is, I’m better at it.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Just as Fu Hua said, everyone has their own strengths!

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' Right, he consoled me just like that before too, so…

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' …I really miss him.

'''Fu Hua:''' So you left all those drawings and puzzles in the city in hopes that he’d see those challenges you left for him when he recovers?

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' Yes.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I see. Thankfully, it’s nothing dangerous.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Speaking of which, did you begin making those puzzles a long time ago?

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' No, my friend was still healthy last year!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Then why were you holding up a number puzzle at the celebration last year?

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' That was the first time I had the courage to make a puzzle. Ah, a year has passed but I’m still not any better at it…

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' …Wait, did I cause trouble for the both of you?

'''Fu Hua:''' Although you had good intentions, you indeed caused our representative here a lot of trouble.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Y-Yeah. You did graffiti on public property in the city, and your graffiti is going to interfere with our judgment and observation while we’re paying close attention to the Honkai beasts’ tracks.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' So, my friend, while we don’t mean to erase your work…

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' S-Sorry! I only thought of myself… I…

'''Fu Hua:''' Thank you for your cooperation.

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' I-I’ll help you clean them up!

Looking at the boy sincerely reflect on himself, Cyan ironically felt guilty.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Here, you can have these photos.

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' These are… of my graffiti?

'''Fu Hua:''' Cyan took pictures of them all. Since the matter has been resolved and they’ve done their job, they can return to their creator.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Once we’ve neutralised all dangers, when you visit your friend with these photos, your works of art can still show how much you missed him.

Graffitiing '''Boy:''' Thank you, Cyan!

One crisis was resolved. Fu Hua looked at Cyan and saw him smile for the first time in a long while.

But… he still hasn’t built enough confidence in himself this time. Perhaps he could do even better next time.
|-|Ending 2, Perfect Conclusion | [CHOICE] - Show him your approval.=
'''Fu Hua:''' Actually, you’ve already done very well, much better than before.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Fu Hua…?

'''Fu Hua:''' You’ve really proven your capabilities this time.

'''Fu Hua:''' You found two clues by yourself and even solved four number puzzles.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Yeah.

'''Fu Hua:''' These small achievements are also thanks to your typically serious attitude too. That’s why you understand every aspect of Qiming. Every person, every house, you…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Hold on, Fu Hua.

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' These four numbers: 7, 4, 1, 6 that we are “all familiar with”. They must be the place that we want to go!

====<u>Thorough Inquiry</u>====
'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' For ease of management, we’ve numbered the streets.

'''Fu Hua:''' Which is to say, this building is located at the intersection of No. 7 and No. 4?

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' That’s right!

'''Fu Hua:''' Let me handle them!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' This is it, a huge house!

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' “1, 6” should correspond to a floor and a room!

This warehouse had been unused for a long time and had long become a place for children to play in and explore instead. The two found the final answer to the puzzle here.

In a corner of a certain empty room, they found a box of what the children saw as precious “treasure”.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I saw research books and art tutorials in that house. There are some here too…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' And not just those, there are drawing materials and…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' A child’s diary.

'''Fu Hua:''' …It’s more important to investigate the truth and remove any possible threats now. We can sincerely apologise for reading someone else’s diary in the future.

After some hesitation, the two carefully opened the cover and saw that the child who loved drawing had written about his longing for his friend.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' So all the graffiti in the city was drawn for his bedridden friend.

'''Fu Hua:''' He wrote those puzzles as a signal for this friend who loved to solve puzzles.

'''Fu Hua:''' He also said that he tried making a puzzle for the first time during last year’s celebration. They promised each other then that they would complete a whole set of puzzles together…

'''Fu Hua:''' But after that, his friend fell sick and they did not continue, until… he met a child who encouraged him to draw all over Qiming to attract his friend’s attention…

'''Fu Hua:''' And so, he wrote those puzzles and included the first puzzle he had completed in them. Fortunately, children have simple thoughts and this friendship only sparked a minor problem.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I’m glad… Seems like it’s nothing serious after all…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I’ll tell Orange about this later, she’s great at comforting others. She can communicate with this child gently to bring a perfect closure to the matter.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' But we still have to clean the graffiti on the walls. Ugh, looking at the quantity, I might have to ask Purple for help… Hm? Fu Hua, why are you smiling?

Cyan seemingly noticed Fu Hua staring at him and looked up, tilting his head in confusion.

Fu Hua You see, you’re really able to take on everything on your own now.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Huh…? T-That’s because you were always encouraging me…

'''Fu Hua:''' But my encouragement alone could not help you solve those graffiti puzzles or solve the case completely.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I…

'''Fu Hua:''' I just dealt with some Honkai beasts that appeared suddenly. I didn’t even assist you during the investigation. You did that all by yourself.

'''Fu Hua:''' Look, you’re stronger and more dependable than you think.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Fu Hua, can I ask you a question?

'''Fu Hua:''' Of course.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Did you go through all this trouble, even splitting up while investigating, just to help me build confidence? …Maybe I’m thinking too much into it, I’m sorry!

'''Fu Hua:''' …No, you’re right, I did that on purpose. How should I put it…?

She shifted her gaze from the boy in front of her and looked up at the distant sky with a nostalgic smile.

'''Fu Hua:''' Every time I see how fearful you are and how you hold yourself back, I’m reminded of how I was at first.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' Huh? Someone amazing like you… used to be like me?

'''Fu Hua:''' Yes. But at any rate, you were already working hard for this city long before I came. You’ve always been a qualified city representative.

'''Fu Hua:''' Back then, I was clumsy with words and never stood out in class. I didn’t even know how to make friends.

'''Fu Hua:''' Although I met many great friends who helped me overcome these as I grew, I can’t help but laugh whenever I look back at the young me.

'''Fu Hua:''' Being overly modest will dwarf your abilities, and poor self-esteem will ultimately become an unnecessary obstacle.

'''Fu Hua:''' I want to help you overcome these because I also wish I could say this to my past self. Sorry, it was a bit selfish of me…

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' I’ve never thought about it like that… It means so much! I-I’ll have to keep it in mind!

'''Fu Hua:''' I’m sure your comrades… the other representatives, also believe in you. Even if it’s just for their sake, you should believe in yourself a little more.

'''<span style="color:#51c29e;">Erudite Vita:</span>''' …Yeah! They are my family, and I can’t let my family down. Thank you, Fu Hua. You can leave the rest to me.

The modest boy smiled shyly and tried to stand up straight with confidence.

He took the diary and ran out, but stopped shortly after to wave goodbye to Fu Hua. She waved back.

Just like that, she bade farewell to her former self.

===Side Story - Mysterious Whereabouts===

====<u>Moment of Danger</u>====
This happened when Fu Hua first came here…

The residents fled in fear. Adults and the elderly evacuated, leaving this small child to bear everything alone.

<span style="color:#516dc2;">'''???:'''</span> Where are these… Honkai beasts coming from?

The Honkai beasts left him with no time to think as it took everything he had to repel their attacks. However, according to his estimation, he couldn’t hold out much longer…

'''Fu Hua:''' Hah!

'''Fu Hua:''' It’s too dangerous here. You should hide while I fight.

<span style="color:#516dc2;">'''???:'''</span> Don’t look down on me. I don’t run from battles.

'''Fu Hua:''' Okay, then we’ll do it together.

<span style="color:#516dc2;">'''???:'''</span> …Okay.

'''Fu Hua:''' It’s finally over… Hm?

Fu Hua thought of the little friend she fought alongside with, and turned back to see him earnestly looking for something.

<span style="color:#516dc2;">'''???:'''</span> What happened? Did I lose it again…?

<span style="color:#516dc2;">'''???:'''</span> Or… was it all part of his plan to get me surrounded by those Honkai beasts?

'''Fu Hua:''' What’s wrong?

<span style="color:#516dc2;">'''???:'''</span> Nothing, thank you. Judging from your appearance, you must be…

Fu Hua also took the opportunity to give the boy a look over. He looked and dressed like the other Vitas, except for his blue collar that gave away his identity.

'''Fu Hua:''' Blue, so you’re…

'''Fu Hua:''' (Mindful Vita… He is one of the two missing Vitas. Why is he here? And from the looks of it… it seems like he doesn’t want to be found by the other Vitas.)

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …You can call me whatever you want.

In sync, the two of them did not reveal the other’s identity, and things became increasingly awkward.

Blue was injured and despondent, seemingly disinterested in Fu Hua.

'''Fu Hua:''' You seem to be looking for someone?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …Just on my daily patrol.

Evidently, he didn’t want Fu Hua to interfere, but he was in no condition to complete the mission himself.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Tsk… It hurts.

Blue tried to move but sighed in pain.

'''Fu Hua:''' Do you need help?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …? Sure. I’m looking for a child that passed by here some time ago. That’s the only clue I have, can you help find him?

'''Fu Hua:''' I’ll try.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Huh? I wasn’t serious. You’ll really help?

'''Fu Hua:''' You don’t have a reason to lie to me. In fact, it’s more like a test for me. Because you need help, but still have to be cautious of me, no?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Ha… You’re just as persistent as described in the records. Alright then, let’s go.

--

====<u>Mutual Decision</u>====
'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …You’re really okay with this? If you don’t want to, now’s the time to tell me.

'''Fu Hua:''' Looking at your current condition, I think I’ll be able to help.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' It’s not easy for me, I’ll admit that, but…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Fu Hua, if you can only run errands, I can get Red and Green as well.

'''Fu Hua:''' But you didn’t.

'''Fu Hua:''' I’m guessing you don’t just look at a problem from a quantitative perspective, hm?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Alright, detective, looks like you’ve got some tricks up your sleeve. Then, where should we begin?

'''Fu Hua:''' <span style="color:#ffe14b;">That ability</span> should come in handy at times like this…

'''Fu Hua:''' Maybe it can help us find the footprints of that child.

'''Fu Hua:''' Found it. That child went this way.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' A resident happens to be there. Let’s ask her.

Enthusiastic Woman: Uh-huh, a little boy came and returned the textbook to my son.

Enthusiastic Woman: There’s nothing suspicious… Children like playing together.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Textbook… Someone like him needs to read textbooks?

'''Fu Hua:''' Uncertain? We should ask those who have interacted with him again.

'''Friendly Girl:''' A child? That’s the paperboy!

'''Friendly Girl:''' Every morning someone delivers a newspaper to my home. It’s normal.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Newspaper… What does this have to do with newspapers?

'''Fu Hua:''' Uncertain? We should ask those who have interacted with him again.

Friendly Man: That boy? He comes every night to pick up tomorrow’s newspaper.

Friendly Man: We met by chance and said hello. He’s a sweet, lovable child.

Night came…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' (Student, newsboy… How many identities does he have?)

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' (Or perhaps, I’ve already lost him?)

Blue muttered to himself. He was usually calm, but now seemed confused.

'''Fu Hua:''' Regardless of who you may be looking for, our pursuit is meaningless, given our current circumstance.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Really? What makes you say that?

'''Fu Hua:''' This child interacted with a lot of people and we were following him to places he had been, questioning people he had met. We will always be one step behind, so it’ll be hard to catch up to him.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …And he hasn’t done anything strange at the moment. We might end up with nothing if we continue investigating this way. Is that what you’re trying to say?

'''Fu Hua:''' That’s right, but this is only a deduction. Considering the current situation, there’s no point asking passersby anything.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …Perhaps.

Blue said that, but he seemed to have a new idea. He subtly checked the wounds on his body without showing any emotions.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' You are very clever indeed, but I’ll handle the rest myself.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …You’ve already helped a lot, and Orange probably wants to bring you around other parts of Qiming. Don’t let her good intentions go to waste.

'''Fu Hua:''' …Oh.

The boy before her politely suggested working alone.

<tabber>
|-|Ending 1, Sweeping Glance | [CHOICE] - Insist on staying with him.=
'''Fu Hua:''' Can you really do it alone in your current condition?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …What’s wrong? It’s common to get hurt, don’t underestimate me.

'''Fu Hua:''' Can you still deal with Honkai beasts if they appear again?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …Fine, come along if you want to.

'''Fu Hua:''' I also have something that I want to investigate and I may need your help.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Alright, leave your courtesies for another time. Let me tell you the next step of our plan…

In the silent shadows nearby, there was a sudden disturbance, barely audible.

'''???:''' So he got reinforcements… I need to reorganise tonight’s operation.

====<u>A Minor Mistake</u>====
'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' I read Cyan’s records. There’s still time before he goes to pick up the newspaper.

'''Fu Hua:''' And there aren’t many passersby. The target should be conspicuous.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Them again… Qiming used to be free from such trouble.

'''Fu Hua:''' You back down, let me handle this.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …That’s not what I meant.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' This way’s blocked.

'''Fu Hua:''' A familiar structure. If I <span style="color:#ffe14b;">find</span> and <span style="color:#ff9594;">destroy</span> its computer, this door will…

'''Fu Hua:''' This is it!

'''Fu Hua:''' The door opened.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Good, let’s go after him.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' How come the intersection is blocked tight?

'''Fu Hua:''' No matter. <span style="color:#a7a7a7;">Leave it to me</span>.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …We made it!

'''Fu Hua:''' The lights in the news agency are on. The person we’re looking for should appear soon.

But when the door creaked open, a boy struggled to carry a stack of fresh newspapers and looked at the two of them confused.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' (...That’s not him. Never mind, this is what I would expect.)

'''Paperboy:''' Are you also… here to collect the newspapers?

'''Paperboy:''' Wait, you’re a city representative! When did you start selling newspapers too?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

'''Fu Hua:''' No. We’re simply curious about tomorrow’s news, so we came early to buy one.

'''Paperboy:''' Sure, no problem.

The suspicious boy handed them a newspaper with an eager look, which surprised the two of them.

'''Fu Hua:''' (How is it?)

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' (The headline states, “Unknown Monsters Appear!” The lifestyle section states, “New Celebration” and “Watch out for abrupt weather changes”... Nothing out of the ordinary…)

'''Paperboy:''' That’s strange. Among the city representatives, there’s Cyan who is great at taking photos and you, Blue, who knows everything that happens in Qiming. Why did you come here to read the newspaper?

The newsboy’s subtle provocation did not anger Blue.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' It’s just a regular inspection. I’m sure you know that the city hasn’t been peaceful lately. Oh, while we’re at it, let us in to take a look.

Mindful Vita pointed to the opened door.

'''Paperboy:''' Sure, please come in.

Fu Hua and Blue looked around, but all the newspapers looked identical and nothing was out of place.

'''Paperboy:''' I don’t know what you’re investigating, but you’ve seen all there is to see. Do you feel assured now?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' I’m a little curious. You’re a newsboy, so why are you delivering textbooks for others?

'''Paperboy:''' I’m just running errands! It’s better to be able to do more… Wait, what’s with that tone, you think I’m up to something?

'''Fu Hua:''' I’m sorry, we were being overly suspicious. After all, there’s a lot happening in the city. We’re taking things more seriously for the safety of the residents.

Fu Hua pretended to withdraw and the newsboy let down his guard.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Do you remember a boy who is as tall as you? He seems to be popular with the other children…

'''Paperboy:''' I don’t, not at all! I talk to lots of people every day, how can I remember them all?

'''Fu Hua:''' (He’s hiding something.)

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' (Yeah.)

The newsboy knew he had said something wrong and immediately cut the conversation short.

'''Paperboy:''' Are you done? You can leave now, I’m going to lock up. I still have to wake early to deliver the papers tomorrow!

Locking the door, the newsboy did not even look back as he left.

'''Fu Hua:''' I’m sorry, if only I acted faster…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' No, they clearly knew that something was up. My plan was not thorough enough.

'''Fu Hua:''' It seems like we didn’t get any more clues.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' No, that newsboy has something to do with all this. As long as we can start investigating him, we’ll find a lead eventually.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Overall, we did gain something out of this. Thank you for your help, you’re just as amazing as rumors say.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' But as you’ve already noticed, I still have a reason to why I cannot appear before the other Vitas now. So please keep what happened today a secret between us.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Then… It has been a pleasure working with you, detective?
|-|Ending 2.1 + 2.2, Perfect Combination + Till We Meet Again | [CHOICE] - Pretend to agree.=
Fu Hua was about to persuade him, but changed her mind.

'''Fu Hua:''' No matter what you’re planning to do, please be cautious.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Mhm, I will, and…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Erm… Thank you for today.

'''Fu Hua:''' You’re welcome. In fact, I should be thanking you. You did not exclude an outsider like me, and even provided me with a lot of help. I’ve learned a lot.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …Yeah, see you later.

Blue covered his wounds as he turned and walked slowly away.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Looks like he just doesn’t want to show his weakness. He’s injured, it’ll be very dangerous if he encounters Honkai beasts again.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (On top of that, I’m curious about what he’s hiding from the other Vitas. Let’s follow him and see.)

====<u>Solo Operation</u>====
'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' It’s getting late. There are few people on the street…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Wait, I think I see strange markings on the street.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' If I look harder…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Will I discover anything?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Are the markings left by children?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Why are they gathered here?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Let’s go forward a bit… Yikes! That was close!

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' It’s those monsters again. We need to go around them.

{{#tag:tabber|Get caught=

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Oh no!

{{#tag:tabber|Ending 2.1, Perfect Combination=
Fu Hua easily defeated the Honkai beasts that had suddenly appeared.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' So you’ve been protecting me this whole time?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' (Darn it… Blue, how could you be so dull? You didn’t even notice that you were being followed?)

'''Fu Hua:''' You were already wounded, and couldn’t fight against the Honkai beasts effectively. It’s normal that you didn’t notice me.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' T-Thank you…

'''Fu Hua:''' Did you find anything? I saw that you stopped there for a while.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Uh, actually…

The boy told Fu Hua about the clues he found and his deductions.

'''Fu Hua:''' Looks like we should hurry over to the news agency. Those children might just be…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Yeah, let’s go!

The two had just arrived near the news agency when they saw a few children hugging a stack of papers as they walked out from the building.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' You guys, stop right there!

Children: Ah, the city representative is here! Run!

'''Fu Hua:''' Stop!

Suddenly, a panicked newsboy rushed out of the building and gripped Fu Hua’s arm tightly.

'''Paperboy:''' Miss, t-they stole my newspapers!

But he refused to let go.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Is this child… trying to buy time? But if I forcefully pull away, he might get hurt…)

While Fu Hua was hesitating, those children split up and disappeared into the night.

'''Paperboy:''' *Sobs* How could they do this…

'''Fu Hua:''' Little one, you…

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Hey, drop the act.

'''Paperboy:''' Huh, why would you suddenly say that?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' You’re with them, so you deliberately held Fu Hua back to buy time for them, right?

'''Paperboy:''' Gosh, I suffered a loss and you’re still on my case?

'''Fu Hua:''' Loss? You mean this?

Fu Hua picked a few pieces of new flyers from the ground; the ink on them hadn’t fully dried. The children dropped them as they ran away.

'''Fu Hua:''' “Test of courage”? A competition to see who can break into the forbidden area first? Should children really be reading this kind of newspaper?

'''Paperboy:''' I-I forgot to say that they didn’t only steal my newspapers, they also used the printer to print this weird stuff.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Among those rowdy children, is there one who is about as tall as you, and very popular…

'''Paperboy:''' No, no! I’ve never seen someone like that!

The newsboy shifted his gaze away and replied hurriedly.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' I see. Since you’re the victim, please go to Green for an investigation.

'''Paperboy:''' Huh?

'''Fu Hua:''' Yes, that’s the only way we can help you find what you lost.

The newsboy was speechless and could only nod helplessly.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Don’t worry, I already informed her. We have witnesses and evidence, Green will be able to make a fair judgment soon.

Blue gave an implicitly profound smile and the newsboy shuddered in fear. Then, Blue turned around and nodded to Fu Hua in gratitude.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' I’m very grateful for your help. Thanks to you, I’m sure the truth behind this matter will be unveiled soon.

'''Fu Hua:''' No need to be so courteous, you seem like you have something else to say.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Indeed. Since we’re both perceptive, let us get straight to the point. Then, what else do you want to ask about, detective?

'''Fu Hua:''' I do have lots of questions, but I don’t think you’ll be able to answer them. Otherwise, why would you hide from the others?

'''Fu Hua:''' After some observations along the way, I believe that you’re not that rash. You must have your reasons for what you do.

'''Fu Hua:''' So, since this matter has been resolved, there’s no need for me to pursue an answer.

'''Fu Hua:''' The only advice I can give you… you’re very smart, so don’t let others take advantage of your intelligence.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Thank you, I’ll keep that in mind.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Oh, would you look at the time? Green will be here soon. I have to leave before she arrives. What happened today is a secret between us.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Then… It has been a pleasure working with you, detective?

Sneak past=

With much effort, Blue finally arrived at the news agency.

{{#tag:tabber|Ending 2.2, Till We Meet Again=
'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Enough, stop hiding. I still need to thank you for secretly protecting me along the way, but there are no monsters you need to deal with here.

Fu Hua walked out from the shade of the trees. The boy before her did not look surprised at all.

'''Fu Hua:''' When did you notice me?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' That’s not important. What’s important is… it’s time to finish this.

He lowered his voice and hinted at Fu Hua to press her ear against the door. She could hear panicked footsteps from the inside.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' I can hear noises inside, he must have realised something and hurried back to clean up the scene.

Blue abruptly pulled the door open and the children who were busily cleaning up various types of papers looked toward him in terror.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' You’ve all been caught red-handed, anything else you guys would like to say?

Fu Hua followed behind him and immediately locked the door. The two of them picked up a few pieces of printed paper scattered around.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' “Test of courage”? A competition to see who can break into the forbidden area first?

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' The newspapers that you’ve been delivering to the residents are actually flyers that encourage children to explore the forbidden area?

Children: …

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' You secretly print these with the news agency’s printers and have the newsboy deliver them to all the children in the city the next day, huh?

Children: …

The children were at a loss for words, and could only stare at each other.
'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Did the person who ordered you to print these flyers tell you that we might come looking for you here?

Panicked Child: Huh? How did you know?

'''Paperboy:''' Hey! I told you not to say anything without thinking!

The newsboy was unable to stop the frightened child from instinctively replying to Blue in time.

'''Paperboy:''' He’s just spouting nonsense, don’t listen to him. We decided to print these flyers ourselves! Nobody ordered us to do it!

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' It’s fine, I already know what’s going on. I’ve already informed Green and you can save the rest for when you talk to her.

The children dejectedly lowered their heads as they agreed. It seems like they were already aware that they had caused a lot of trouble. Blue walked toward Fu Hua, who was standing by the door, and nodded to her in gratitude.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Thank you for your help. I’ve already gotten the gist of what happened.

'''Fu Hua:''' Glad I could help.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' You’re not going to ask anything? After all… we’ve been keeping our guard up with one another.

'''Fu Hua:''' I don’t need to. Your actions have proven my hypothesis, so I trust your judgment.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Oh? Tell me about it.

'''Fu Hua:''' When you mentioned that person just now, you were alluding to someone in particular. Although you chose to hide from the other representatives and acted alone, to be covertly investigating this means that you’re not completely manipulated by someone else.

'''Fu Hua:''' You have an extraordinary mind and high vigilance. You must have already thought this through when you chose this method of action.

'''Fu Hua:''' For example… Against a sly opponent, to avoid alerting the other party, you chose to hide the matter from your comrades. Therefore, they wouldn’t be dragged into this.

'''Fu Hua:''' In a certain way, you were also protecting them.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' …

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Impressive.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' I cannot comment on your hypothesis, seeing that you’ve already found the reason. But I must say… you are the second person that I look up to, ever since I had become a city representative.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Hmm? Then the first one could be…)

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' It might be ominous to say this, but… if something really happens to me, I’ll be counting on you. I’m sure you can turn the tables even in the most devastating disaster.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' I believe in your abilities and even more so in your decisions. Let’s keep what happened today a secret between us.

'''<span style="color:#516dc2;">Mindful Vita:</span>''' Then… It has been a pleasure working with you, detective?

===Side Story - Strange Scent===

====<u>Important Mission</u>====
This happened when Fu Hua first came here…

In a corner of the supposedly peaceful city of Qiming, abrupt noises of battle could be heard.

<span style="color:#edbe3a;">'''???:'''</span> Stop! You… You monsters, keep your hands off the city!

'''Fu Hua:''' That voice… it’s…

Fu Hua looked toward the source of that voice and saw a petite girl evacuating fearful residents.

As a result, the berserking Honkai beasts turned their attention to her. The girl could not hide the trepidation in her face, but she didn’t know how to handle the situation. She could only shout with all her might.

'''Fu Hua:''' Get out now! I’ll deal with these Honkai beasts!

<span style="color:#edbe3a;">'''???:'''</span> Erm, lady… Can you really do it alone…?

'''Fu Hua:''' Don’t worry. Leave without me!

'''Fu Hua:''' (Somehow these Honkai beasts feel crankier than usual…)

With the crisis resolved, Fu Hua prepared to leave, but saw that the young girl was still standing nearby.

<span style="color:#edbe3a;">'''???:'''</span> Thank you for saving us, Miss! You’re so strong!

'''Fu Hua:''' You look and dress the same as the other Vitas, and the color on your clothes… You must be Veracious Vita.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Yes! Although I’ve not formally introduced myself, you’re right! You can just call me Yellow. I’ve read a lot about you from the records that the other Vitas uploaded!

Yellow smiled amicably and seemed genuinely happy to meet Fu Hua.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Yellow and Blue are both avoiding the other Vitas and working alone. Perhaps… this is a good opportunity to ask what they’re doing?)

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Oh no! Blue specifically emphasised that I shouldn’t talk to you. He said that I was too honest and that I would spill everything when asked…

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' What should I do? I promised Blue that I would keep everything a secret before it’s resolved!

'''Fu Hua:''' (...Let’s not put her in a spot.)

'''Fu Hua:''' Don’t worry, it’s fine, I won’t ask about the both of you. You can continue to keep it a secret.

'''Fu Hua:''' Speaking of which, why are you working alone? How would you have handled that crisis alone?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' About that…

She looked around and only stepped closer to Fu Hua after ensuring that nobody else would hear her.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I came here to complete an important mission!

'''Fu Hua:''' Important mission?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Yeah, it’s because of the anomaly in Qiming!

'''Fu Hua:''' How are you going to investigate the issue alone in such a huge city?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I’ve already discovered the anomaly!

Veracious Vita inhaled deeply.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Miss, there’s a very strange smell in Qiming today.

'''Fu Hua:''' Huh?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' You’re a guest, so it’s natural that you don’t understand.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' This smell belongs to the gas that is commonly used in Qiming. Because it’s easily combustible, this sharp scent is intentionally added during its preparation.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Heard that there was a problem with the seal on this batch of gas. I came here to check on every house and keep an eye on their usage.

'''Fu Hua:''' (Do those rampant Honkai beasts have something to do with this smell?)

--

====<u>Something Amiss</u>====
'''Fu Hua:''' (A problem with the gas seal… That’s sudden. It sounds like there’s something more behind this matter.)

'''Fu Hua:''' It worries me to leave Yellow to deal with this alone… After all, she does look very gullible.

Looking at the determined girl, Fu Hua couldn’t help but step forward.

'''Fu Hua:''' Yellow, how about we investigate together?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Oh, are you also curious about this issue?

'''Fu Hua:''' Erm… actually…

'''Fu Hua:''' (How should I explain this to her? Would it be hurtful if I explained myself directly…? Let me think… Oh right!)

'''Fu Hua:''' Erm, when I just arrived here, the Vitas took good care of me and I managed to familiarise myself with this city, thanks to all of you.

'''Fu Hua:''' Now that such a severe problem has surfaced in QIming, it would be great if I could offer some help…

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' You’re willing to help me? Awesome!

Fu Hua wasn’t good at lying, but Yellow did not doubt her far-fetched excuse and hesitant tone. This made Fu Hua a little guilty, and she could only make up for it with her full cooperation.

'''Fu Hua:''' Then let’s begin, where should we start?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I asked several children. They don’t know anything.

'''Fu Hua:''' Maybe it’s because children lack wariness. Let’s try asking some adults?

Woman Who Visits Neighbors: What? Always smelling gas in the city? I haven’t heard about it.

Woman Who Visits Neighbors: By the way, I heard strange-flavored candies are popular in Qiming. I wish I were brave enough to try them!

Man Whose Smelling is Keen: Hmm… I am smelling something I can’t describe.

Man Whose Smelling is Keen: You can smell it too, can’t you? It’s very weak here, but stronger there.

The man provided a clue. Use your special ability to track it.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' This is incredible! Now we can track smells that are invisible and intangible!

'''Fu Hua:''' This smell is thicker in crowded places? Let’s go there.

Old Woman Whose Cooking is Superb: Lately, I’ve been smelling something strange in the kitchen and streets. But…

Old Woman Whose Cooking is Superb:  If it was a gas leak, we probably wouldn’t be here.

====<u>Thorough Investigation</u>====
They barely got any information from the residents, leaving Fu Hua and Yellow at a loss.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Strange, this smell truly exists, which means that the information I got isn’t wrong.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Places with more people also have a stronger smell. If it’s the gas, this will cause very severe consequences.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Who has the capability to leak every household gas everywhere?

'''Fu Hua:''' There’s no way that the diligent Vitas wouldn’t notice an accident like this.

'''Fu Hua:''' (This scent is rather familiar… I’ve smelled it somewhere before…)

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' You mean this smell might not be caused by a gas leak? Hmm… Eh?

Yellow seemingly realised something and held Fu Hua’s hand in alarm.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Miss, look at those people there, don’t they seem a little suspicious?

Two transporters observed their surroundings as they brought a large sealed box of goods to Changgeng.

'''Fu Hua:''' Weird… Why are they heading toward Changgeng?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I’m not sure if I’m imagining things, but I feel like they’re covered in that scent!

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' They must’ve hidden the tools they used in Changgeng! Let’s hurry to Changgeng and take a look!

'''Fu Hua:''' Let me think…

<tabber>
|-|Ending 1.1 + 1.2, A Hasty Farewell + Sincere and Mutual | [CHOICE] - Follow the smell and continue investigating.=
'''Fu Hua:''' If this smell is really from a gas leak, as the old lady had said, we wouldn’t be here.

'''Fu Hua:''' We should start searching from crowded places where the smell is stronger.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Miss, look over there!

'''Fu Hua:''' Are you referring to that man?

A young man blended into the crowd, quietly tugged at a passerby next to him, and gave him something fragmented.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Yeah, he’s behaving strangely.

'''Fu Hua:''' Wait, let’s continue observing for now.

The two looked at each other and the young man left immediately. The way he looked around made it seem like he was looking for his next target.

'''Fu Hua:''' Very suspicious indeed, let’s go after him!

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' We can split up.

'''Fu Hua:''' (...I really don’t want to say anything that will demoralise her.)

'''Fu Hua:''' Yellow, in my hometown, we believe that to defeat an enemy, it’s better to aim for its most immediate vulnerability.

'''Fu Hua:''' We just have to capture him red-handed and it’ll be hard for him to deny his involvement in this matter.

Yellow nodded despite her uncertainty.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Oh… Then… Let’s go together.

--

====<u>Follow and Pursue</u>====
'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Ah! More monsters!

'''Fu Hua:''' Why do Honkai beasts appear whenever we smell that stink?

'''Fu Hua:''' What if they were also drawn here by it?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' He’s there! We’re lucky we didn’t lose him!

'''Fu Hua:''' He’s also being careful, that slowed him down.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' What’s he doing? Why did he suddenly stop?

'''Fu Hua:''' Maybe he’s also looking for new targets.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' He went that way!

'''Fu Hua:''' Now!

--

====<u>Shocking Occurrence</u>====
'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I said, halt!

Suspicious Man: Oh no, it’s Yellow!

The man saw Yellow and immediately fled in the opposite direction, but Fu Hua stopped him in time!

Suspicious Man: Yellow, and… that lady over there, why are the two of you staring at me that way? I-I didn’t do anything bad…

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' If you didn’t do anything bad, why are you running away? Wait, you’re…

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' You’re Barry who owns the candy shop.

'''Fu Hua:''' Sir, please open your bag and allow us to perform a check.

Barry: There’s really nothing dangerous inside… Really…

'''Fu Hua:''' Open it.

Barry: Fine, fine, don’t get angry. I really don’t have anything worth checking here.

The man reluctantly opened his bag.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Ugh, what a terrible smell… It smells even worse up close!

'''Fu Hua:''' So these are candies…

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Huh, this stink comes from candies?

'''Fu Hua:''' Yeah, these are candies made from a fruit with a unique scent. Some people love them, some people find them unappetising.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' They can’t compare to the candies that Miss Vita brings back!

Barry: Look, I said that there’s nothing dangerous, right? It’s getting late, I should also be leaving…

'''Fu Hua:''' Wait…

{{#tag:tabber|[CHOICE] - Why are you doing this?=
'''Fu Hua:''' Why are you so cautious over mere candies?

Barry: These are all candies from the shop, I’m just delivering them to a customer.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' In that case, you really aren’t doing anything dangerous!

Barry: Alright, then I’ll be leaving. If you’re interested, drop by the store next time.

'''Fu Hua:''' No…

Fu Hua’s suspicion seemingly made him more nervous and he unconsciously clenched his bag. Yellow pulled at the handle of the bag and…

…Candies scattered all over the ground.

Barry: Oh, my candies!

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Woah, what a nasty smell!

A pungent smell wafted out of the broken bag, which got some strange looks from passersby and even attracted some uninvited guests…

'''Fu Hua:''' Everyone, retreat! Those are Honkai beasts!

{{#tag:tabber|Ending 1.1, A Hasty Farewell=
====<u>Trivial Matter</u>====
'''Fu Hua:''' As expected, the Honkai beasts are extremely sensitive to the smell of these candies. Perhaps, they are the reason why the Honkai beasts are exceptionally aggressive.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I see. No wonder I always encounter monsters when I smell this scent!

Barry: …

The candy shop owner trembled in fear.

'''Fu Hua:''' Did you know that these candies would cause such a ruckus?

Barry: I… I didn’t know that they would bring so much trouble…

Barry: I-I thought that if I was carefully enough and the quantity was small, nothing would happen…

'''Fu Hua:''' There’s nothing wrong with the durian candies themselves, they have a unique flavor that some people enjoy. However, you didn't know that the Honkai beasts would also be interested in them.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Durian candies? So that’s what they’re called!

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I gotta give one to Miss Vita the next time I see her!

'''Fu Hua:''' Yellow, hold on…

'''Fu Hua:''' Regardless, these have sparked fear and concerns to Qiming. Before the disturbance from the Honkai beasts is dealt with, I’m afraid the Vitas have to control the trade of durian candies. It’s not too late to try them after this issue has been resolved.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' As expected of Fu Hua, you’re so thorough!

Barry: Sorry, I’ll… I’ll cooperate and recall all the candies sold.

With the matter resolved, the naive girl thanked Fu Hua enthusiastically.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Thank you for your help!

'''Fu Hua:''' You’re welcome, Yellow.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Hehe, the anomaly has been found and my task is complete! I need to go back and tell him!

'''Fu Hua:''' …?

Before Fu Hua could react, Yellow left joyfully.

[CHOICE] - The box that was moved to Changgeng...=
'''Fu Hua:''' (He probably has something to do with that box.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (But… without any evidence, how can I make him confess?)

Fu Hua scrutinised the shop owner before her, and an idea came to mind…

{{#tag:tabber|Ending 1.2, Sincere and Mutual=
====<u>Unconcealed Truth</u>====
After some thought, Fu Hua made a decision…

'''Fu Hua:''' You hired two workers and moved a box to Changgeng.

Barry: H-How can you prove that the box belongs to me?

'''Fu Hua:''' (At this point, I might have to deceive him…)

Fu Hua smiled slightly and made herself look confident.

'''Fu Hua:''' We’ve checked the items in that box. Not only did it contain the ingredients for these candies, even packaging bags from the store had been left in it.

Barry: Hmph, how can that be? I checked it personally! And who would use a packaging bag when opening candies?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Huh? So… it really was you.

Barry: …Um.

The man realised that he had admitted to his crimes and could only confess everything.

Barry: Fine, I admit that the strange smell in Qiming comes from these candies. But I only began to make and sell them a few days ago, that’s for sure!

'''Fu Hua:''' There’s nothing with the durian candies themselves, they have a unique flavor that some people enjoy. However, you didn’t know that the Honkai beasts would also be interested in them.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Durian candies? So that’s what they’re called!

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I’ve never seen a candy like that, not even at Orange’s place.

Barry: Uh, about that…

Barry: A few kids told me about it. They said that this fruit was popular with children nowadays, and even claimed that their leader wanted to spend all his allowance on candies of this flavor…

'''Fu Hua:''' I didn’t think that the preferences of children would be so persuasive.

Barry: The children in Qiming love to jump on the bandwagon, this would definitely bring me a lot of profit, so… I secretly developed this candy’s recipe behind my competitors’ backs.

Barry: I also knew that it smelled a little… scary, but I didn’t think that the consequences would be so severe.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' So you have to think before you act!

Barry: I’m sorry, I really am sorry…

'''Fu Hua:''' Don’t be too nervous, there’s nothing wrong with earning money through legal means. And this smell can only attract Honkai beasts to a certain extent, it didn’t cause any irreversible damage.

'''Fu Hua:''' I believe that your candies can truly bring happiness to those children.

Barry: Thank you for defending me… I’ll definitely retrieve the durian shells I threw in Changgeng and get rid of them appropriately.

Yellow waved happily at the man as he walked into the distance, with her initial bright smile back on her face.

'''Fu Hua:''' Is it okay if you don’t follow him?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Huh? He promised to deal with it appropriately, so Qiming will return to normal soon!

'''Fu Hua:''' (Just as Orange said, Yellow is extremely honest and doesn’t doubt others either.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (Such unreserved trust and sincerity are Yellow’s strengths, I suppose.)

'''Fu Hua:''' Indeed, but selling candy privately might have violated the regulations that the representatives have put in place. We should tell Green about this later.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Yeah! Green is the best when it comes to handling such matters!

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Hehe, thanks to you, the anomaly has been found and my task is complete! I need to go back and tell him!

'''Fu Hua:''' …Him?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Ah! O-Oh no, I need to keep this a secret. I’m so sorry…

'''Fu Hua:''' (I’ve always had a strange feeling… This incident wasn’t dangerous or complex. It was tedious at best.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (If this wasn’t an accident, but a plot that someone had planned from the beginning, everything would make sense.)

'''Fu Hua:''' (I’m afraid the objective is… to distract Yellow at the appropriate time and stop her from interrupting him. After all, people who are overly honest can be a handful sometimes.)

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Fu Hua? What are you thinking about?

'''Fu Hua:''' Yellow, listen to me. The person that you’re following is likely taking advantage of you. I know you’re not one to doubt others, but it’s different this time.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Ah, so you’re worried about me! Thank you, but it’s alright, I’m fine.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I know that I attract trouble and suffer losses because of my personality, I’ve also considered if I should change myself a little.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' But the other Vitas always say that they will find a way to handle things and I don’t have to overthink it.

'''Fu Hua:''' All of you get along so well, like a family.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Yeah! We’re a family. I can comfortably be myself when they’re around. More importantly…

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Regardless if it’s being genuine toward others or fully trusting others, I think both are necessary.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Because if nobody did that, we would grow further apart from each other!

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' To gain someone’s trust, you should offer your trust first. To be able to maintain your sincerity after being hurt or betrayed shows that you have the greatest courage.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' This sincerity will eventually be conveyed. As long as everyone can trust each other just a bit more, my wish has been fulfilled.

'''Fu Hua:''' (...So she’s thought deeply into this. Indeed, the city representatives aren’t children, I may have underestimated them.)

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I believe in others because I want to. Love and trust are the most beautiful things in this world, and I want everyone to feel that.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' If I can accomplish that by suffering some losses or being tricked, it’s worth it! Even if I get myself into trouble, I believe that the other Vitas can resolve it perfectly. And…

The young girl looked up at Fu Hua with bright eyes filled with unconcealed joy.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' You’re here too! You’re so strong, smart, and helpful!

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' With you and the seven Vitas around, we can overcome any difficulties, right?

'''Fu Hua:''' Yeah, you’re right. I promise that I’ll beat up anyone who betrays your trust.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Hehe, I’ll be counting on you then!

The young girl smiled widely, looking as radiant as the sky.

|-|Ending 2, False Alarm | [CHOICE] - Investigate the suspicious transporters.=
After a brief hesitation, Fu Hua decided to trust the girl’s judgment, and they headed to Changgeng.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Uwah, they disappeared! What should we do…?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Changgeng is huge, where should we start looking…?

'''Fu Hua:''' Yellow, don’t worry, you can still smell that scent.

'''Fu Hua:''' As long as that smell doesn’t dissipate, we can search for them via the scent.

{{#tag:tabber|Ending 2, False Alarm=
====<u>Accidental Discovery</u>====
'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' You’re amazing! If only I had these killer moves like you do.

'''Fu Hua:''' You have your own merits. You don’t have to admire others.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Ah! Monsters again!

'''Fu Hua:''' Just how important is this thing to warrant such a dangerous hiding place?

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' The stench is growing more apparent.

'''Fu Hua:''' I hear strange noises coming from ahead…

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' These monsters are ferocious!

'''Fu Hua:''' They are, I wonder if it has anything to do with the smell.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' The smell’s gotten worse!

'''Fu Hua:''' Yellow, stay alert.

'''Fu Hua:''' The smell attracted the Honkai beasts as I expected.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Fu Hua, you be careful too!

After some trials and tribulations, the two finally caught up to the source of the smell, but the transporters who were moving the mysterious goods were nowhere to be found.

The box was sealed tightly, yet its smell was pungent. The simple-minded Yellow immediately reached to open it.

'''Fu Hua:''' Yellow, let me do it.

'''Fu Hua:''' After all, it could be a container of dangerous gas inside, and this scent caused the Honkai beasts to go berserk.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' T-Then what about you?

Yellow frowned and looked at Fu Hua anxiously.

'''Fu Hua:''' It’s fine, it won’t be something I can’t handle. Otherwise, those transporters wouldn’t have casually moved it back and forth, nor would they have left it here.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' You have to be careful!

'''Fu Hua:''' Yeah, step back a little.

Fu Hua tore the tape around the box away and lifted its lid. A putrid yet familiar smell of rot filled the air. She calmed herself and looked in…

'''Fu Hua:''' So it’s really this thing… that’s giving off this smell.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Huh, what is it?

Yellow saw that Fu Hua was alright and stepped forward to peer into the box curiously. On top of that, for better observation, she stuck her hand into the box…

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Ouch! It bit me!

'''Fu Hua:''' Don’t worry, it’s a special type of fruit. It’s very similar to a durian from my hometown. This box contains its spiked shell.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Fruit? There’s a fruit with such a horrible smell?

'''Fu Hua:''' Some people like to eat it, oddly enough. However, the smell of its flesh is more distinct. If those people threw its shell in Changgeng, the fruit could have been left in Qiming.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' I remember, I’ve seen this thing a long time ago! I was badly pricked by it when I first saw it, so the other Vitas never allowed me to touch it again.

'''Fu Hua:''' (As expected… the other Vitas always take good care of her.)

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Which means that the issue we’ve been investigating all this time was simply caused by this fruit?

'''Fu Hua:''' Although we’re pretty sure that Qiming isn’t at risk of any explosions or fires…

'''Fu Hua:''' If this scent can cause Honkai beasts to go berserk, we should be more careful.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' You’re right! Someone might have used this characteristic to cause trouble!

'''Fu Hua:''' It’s good to be wary, we can eliminate worse possibilities that way.

'''<span style="color:#edbe3a;">Veracious Vita:</span>''' Mhm, you’re right!

Fu Hua patted the girl on her head and sighed in relief.

However, the two of them weren’t completely at ease.
